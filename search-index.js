An acquirer is a special form of financial service provider for credit cards. Merchants are screened and accepted into the acquirer’s credit card program for which merchants need to conclude corresponding acceptance contracts. To process credit card data, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) needs to be fulfilled which can be handled by a payment service provider. Address Verification System is a system primarily used to combat fraud that verifies whether the billing address of the credit card matches the address that was given by the consumer in the online shop, i.e. the system checks the billing address of the credit card provided by the consumer with the address on file at the credit card company. Alphanumeric is a combination of alphabetic and numeric characters and is used to describe the collection of Latin letters and Arabic digits or a text constructed from this collection. The back-end offers the possibility to execute back-end operations for successful payments like deposit, refund or recurring payments. Backend operations both for Checkout Seamless and Checkout Page are called by a server-to-server request from the web server to the hobex Checkout Server. These operations are possible to call automatically from the backend or manually from the user interface. They’re subdivided into two categories: Transaction Based Operations Non-transaction-based Operations A boolean is a data type that has two values: TRUE FALSE ON OFF YES NO The checkout process is an umbrella term containing the following subordinate steps a consumer has to go through when checking out the items in the shopping basket: Registration and entry of personal data Entry of shipping information Selection of shipping method Selection of payment method, entry of payment method specific data, a commitment of payment, receipt of payment result Return to the online shop to proceed CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to format the design and layout of an HTML page that is displayed in a web browser. A customer is a person who bought and uses hobex Service IT solutions and services. In the context of hobex Service IT, a merchant is a customer. Merchant unique ID is used to identify the online shop within the hobex Checkout Server. hobex Service IT uses customerId in any communication between the merchant and hobex Service IT. A consumer is a person who purchases real or digital goods in an online shop. Data storage stores sensitive payment data entered by the consumer during the payment process in the online shop when Checkout Seamless is used. The merchant doesn’t need a PCI-compliant online shop and web server since sensitive payment data such as credit card numbers, expiration date, etc. are directly sent from a web form in the online shop to the hobex Service IT data storage, thus bypassing the web server. The data storage is unique to each and valid for 30 minutes after the latest access. Typical financial service providers (FSP) are credit card companies, banks and banking systems. Their field of activities includes accepting money transfer requests, approval or denial of transactions and processing of payments. Since every payment request needs to be processed, the payment service provider, i.e. hobex Service IT, transmits the payment information to the respective financial service provider. The payment is approved or denied and corresponding information is sent back to the payment service provider. Merchants need to close appropriate contract(s) with a financial service provider(s) depending on the payment methods they want to offer. The processed amount is transferred to the corresponding merchant’s account by the FSP. A fingerprint is a method to ensure that sensitive parameters and their values sent from the online shop to the hobex Checkout Server and vice versa are not changed by anyone who is transferring the data over the Internet. The frontend receives the order data of the consumer in the online shop and handles the user interface for the payment process, especially the presentation of external pages of financial service providers like internet banking pages or pages for entering the 3-D Secure code. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language for layout web pages. An integrator implements an online shop for a merchant and integrates hobex Service IT solutions into the checkout process of the online shop. Institutions such as banks, credit unions, savings, and loan associations, or even retailers issue credit cards to consumers and provide them with a credit line. JavaScript is a programming language that is typically used in web browsers to add dynamic and interactive elements and functionality to an HTML page. A merchant is the owner or operator of an online shop. This is typically a customer of hobex Service IT using our solutions. MOTO stands for accepting credit and debit cards by phone or via e-mail to settle a purchase, i.e. the consumer enters the website from any computer, selects an item or service, and calls or e-mails the merchant in order to place an order. More about the possibilities hobex Service IT offers to handle MOTO transactions is on the following link → Credit Card - Mail Order and Telephone Orders. A non-transaction-based operation is a backend-operation that does not depend on existing orders i.e. such operations are carried out independently of any existing orders. An online shop is a virtual shop accessible from a browser on the desktop computer, tablet or smartphone. In some cases also native apps for iOS or Android devices are called online shops, although this is not always appropriate from a technical point of view. With the transaction a deposit is done immediately. This also means there is no payment in the approved state. Most alternative payment methods have this as a default configuration, but some can be changed to two steps. The specific details for payment methods can be checked here. When the payment of a certain amount is authorized, some financial service providers offer a one-off deposit of less than the authorized amount, e.g. if the price of the item the consumer ordered is reduced. Not to be confused with a split capture. Payment method is a specific way the consumer selects for purchasing a product in the online shop. Typical payment methods are credit cards, direct debits, invoices or installments. The payment process is part of the checkout process and includes the following steps: Selection of payment method Entry of payment method specific data Commitment of payment Receipt of payment result A payment service provider (PSP), i.e. hobex Service IT, offers a technical interface allowing the online shop to interact with financial service providers. Payment service providers also assist merchants with supplementary services such as integration of payment methods, fraud and risk management, compliance with PCI DSS, etc. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a binding set of rules and procedures established by four major credit card companies (Visa, Mastercard, Discover and American Express) in 2004 and is aimed at companies that accept credit cards as a payment method. The primary objective of PCI DSS is the prevention of fraud and theft of credit card data on the Internet. The PCI DSS Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) is a tool that merchant may use to determine whether the online shop meets established PCI DSS requirements. Different versions of the PCI DSS SAQ are available to cover all possible merchant scenarios. A secret is a (pre-shared key) that is only known to the merchant, the integrator of the online shop and hobex Service IT. This secret is used to secure the transfer of all sensitive parameters and their values between the online shop and the hobex Checkout Server. A shop plugin is an additional module that is installed in the merchant’s online shop. Our free-of-charge shop plugins which we offer for many popular shop systems, serve as a technical connection between the shop system and Checkout Page or Checkout Seamless, or both for some plugins. For the installation of a shop plugin, typically no programming work is required. Shop plugins are constantly updated and improved in order to be compatible with the current version of the shop systems and to offer merchants all available payment methods. When the payment of a certain amount is authorized, some financial service providers offer to deposit the total amount not in one single deposit but in multiple smaller deposits. E.g. when shipping only some items from the consumer’s shopping basket,the merchant can make deposits for each separate shipping up to the total authorized amount (e.g. 100 authorized, 2×50 deposited). Not to be confused with partial capture. A (financial) transaction is a communication carried out between the consumer of the online shop, the merchant and the financial institution to exchange an asset for payment. A transaction-based operation is a backend operation that depends on existing orders, i.e. orders which have been completed by the consumers in the online shop and which are at the disposal for further actions. Authorization is performed, the amount is reserved, but no money flow will be triggered automatically. The deposit in the second step will charge the money from the consumer’s account. As an independent service provider for secure settlement of online payment transactions, hobex Service IT offers solutions for any checkout process with more than 20 tailor-made payment methods available to consumers. Same as the profound technical, commercial, and consultant knowledge of experienced staff who has been working in this sector for many years. hobex Service IT: http://sit.hobex.at hobex Checkout Server is our technology platform where our payment solutions are running as PaaS (Platform as a Service). Payment Center is our online portal and allows merchants to search and view payments and start additional operations and transactions, e.g. approve or refund. The merchant can access the Payment Center in demo mode by using test as username and jcv45z as password. If a merchant uses the Payment Center in demo mode then displayed demo data is immutable. Security approach originally developed by Visa for online credit card payments with the main objective being the reduction of fraud and credit card abuse. By offering 3-D Secure, merchants benefit from payment guarantees and will receive the outstanding amounts even in case of a consumer payment default (a liability shift from the merchant to the card issuer occurs). During the payment process, the consumer first enters the credit card number. A connection is established to the card issuer and the consumer is prompted to enter the 3-D Secure code which is only known to him in order to prove that he is the authorized card holder. After successful authentication, the transaction is carried out. The 3-D Secure code is defined by the cardholder during the registration process and must not be confused with the 3 or 4 digit CVC code which is printed on the back of a credit card. The most common services using 3-D Secure are American Express SafeKey, Visa Secure, and Mastercard ID Check.","title":"Glossary","component":"online-guides","version":"main","name":"glossary","url":"/glossary/","titles":[{"text":"Glossary","hash":"glossary","id":1},{"text":"A","hash":"A","id":2},{"text":"Acquirer or Acquiring bank","hash":"acquirer","id":3},{"text":"Address Verification System (AVS)","hash":"AVS","id":4},{"text":"Alphanumeric","hash":"alphanumeric","id":5},{"text":"B","hash":"B","id":6},{"text":"Backend","hash":"backend","id":7},{"text":"Backend Operation","hash":"backendOperation","id":8},{"text":"Boolean","hash":"boolean","id":9},{"text":"C","hash":"C","id":10},{"text":"Checkout Process","hash":"checkoutProcess","id":11},{"text":"CSS","hash":"CSS","id":12},{"text":"Customer","hash":"customer","id":13},{"text":"CustomerId","hash":"customerId","id":14},{"text":"Consumer","hash":"consumer","id":15},{"text":"D","hash":"D","id":16},{"text":"Data Storage","hash":"dataStorage","id":17},{"text":"F","hash":"F","id":18},{"text":"Financial Service Provider","hash":"financialServiceProvider","id":19},{"text":"Fingerprint","hash":"fingerprint","id":20},{"text":"Frontend","hash":"frontend","id":21},{"text":"H","hash":"H","id":22},{"text":"HTML","hash":"HTML","id":23},{"text":"I","hash":"I","id":24},{"text":"Integrator","hash":"integrator","id":25},{"text":"Issuer or Issuing Bank","hash":"issuer","id":26},{"text":"J","hash":"J","id":27},{"text":"JavaScript","hash":"javaScript","id":28},{"text":"M","hash":"M","id":29},{"text":"Merchant","hash":"merchant","id":30},{"text":"MOTO (Mail Order and Telephone Order)","hash":"MOTO","id":31},{"text":"N","hash":"N","id":32},{"text":"Non-transaction-based operation","hash":"nonTransactionBasedOperation","id":33},{"text":"O","hash":"O","id":34},{"text":"Online Shop","hash":"onlineShop","id":35},{"text":"One Step Transaction","hash":"oneStepTransaction","id":36},{"text":"P","hash":"P","id":37},{"text":"Partial Capture","hash":"partialCapture","id":38},{"text":"Payment Method","hash":"paymentMethod","id":39},{"text":"Payment Process","hash":"paymentProcess","id":40},{"text":"Payment Service Provider","hash":"PSP","id":41},{"text":"PCI DSS","hash":"DSS","id":42},{"text":"S","hash":"S","id":43},{"text":"SAQ","hash":"SAQ","id":44},{"text":"Secret or Pre-shared Key","hash":"secret","id":45},{"text":"Shop Plugin","hash":"shopPlugin","id":46},{"text":"Split Capture","hash":"splitCapture","id":47},{"text":"T","hash":"T","id":48},{"text":"Transaction","hash":"transaction","id":49},{"text":"Transaction-based Operation","hash":"transactionBasedOperation","id":50},{"text":"Two Step Transaction","hash":"twoStepTransaction","id":51},{"text":"Q","hash":"Q","id":52},{"text":"hobex Service IT","hash":"companyName","id":53},{"text":"hobex Checkout Server","hash":"companyServerName","id":54},{"text":"Payment Center","hash":"centerProductName","id":55},{"text":"3-D Secure","hash":"3DSecure","id":56}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":".uk-card-default { background: #a1b4c4 !important;

The primary objective of PCI DSS is the prevention of fraud and theft of credit card data on the Internet. Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQ) are tools that merchant may use upon request by the acquirer to determine whether the online shop meets established PCI DSS requirements. To ensure the highest level of data security, the acquirer will request to fill out a specific Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) prior to concluding an acceptance contract with the merchant. The handling and management of sensitive financial data in online shops is always a crucial issue in fulfilling the relevant SAQs and obtaining PCI-compliance. However, there is no need for the online shop to handle or store sensitive data since all necessary financial and personal data required for the payment process are handled by the hobex Checkout Server. When choosing hobex Service IT as the PCI-compliant third-party payment processor, it becomes much easier to comply with the relevant SAQ requested by the acquirer and no additional PCI-compliance for the online shop is required. There are various SAQ versions available to select from to best suit the business profile. The following SAQs are applicable when using hobex Service IT products: SAQ version Business scenario Applicable for hobex Service IT solution SAQ A Applicable for card-not-present merchants, when all cardholder data functions are outsourced to a PCI-compliant payment processor. Eligible e-commerce implementations: when the merchant website is entirely hosted and administered by a compliant third-party payment processor, or provides an iframe to a PCI-compliant third-party payment processor or contains a URL link redirecting consumers from the merchant website to a PCI-compliant payment processor. Visit implementation examples eligible for SAQ A vs. SAQ A-EP for more information and details. Checkout Page in the native app as a web view. Checkout Seamless with \"PCI DSS SAQ A Compliance\" in the native app as a web view. SAQ A-EP Applicable for card-not-present merchants who partially outsource their e-commerce payment channel to PCI DSS validated third parties and don’t electronically store, process or transmit any cardholder data on their systems or premises. Checkout Seamless without \"PCI DSS SAQ A Compliance\" in the native app as a web view. SAQ C-VT Applicable for merchants using only web-based virtual terminals, without electronic cardholder Data Storage. Checkout Terminal SAQ D All other merchants not covered by any SAQ and all service providers defined by a payment brand as eligible to complete a SAQ. Checkout Automated Put the file(s) where the secret or password is defined within a folder on the file system of the web server which can’t be accessed by users accessing the web server via their web browsers. It is strongly recommended to encrypt any communication in the online shop to allow access only by secure communication via https. Checkout Page and Checkout Seamless also use secure communication based on https and if the online shop or parts of the online shop are accessed by http the consumer in the online shop will receive the security warning from the web browser. It is strongly recommended to save all relevant order data of each purchase and of each consumer before starting the Checkout Page or Checkout Seamless immediately after the payment has been made by the consumer. This way assign and correlate each order with the relevant payment process results at a later date. Ensure, according to the functionalities of the online shop, that the consumer has no possibility to change the items in the shopping basket once the payment process was started. Check all security updates available for the software that is used within the online shop, database, and web server on a regular basis. Have a look at OWASP regarding typical security risks and their impacts on online sites. Configure scheduled backups for all order and checkout-related information of the consumers of the online shop to ensure that the merchant has these data at their disposal in case of any later complaints or frauds. A secret is a pre-shared key that is only known to the merchant, the integrator of the online shop and hobex Service IT. The secret is used to secure the transfer of all sensitive parameters and their values between the online shop and the Checkout Page and Checkout Seamless. To ensure secure communication it’s essential to NEVER disclose or share the pre-shared key with persons who are not involved in developing the online shop! Never forward this pre-shared key via unsecured communication channels. When the pre-shared key is submitted by fax make sure that the contents of the fax are disclosed only to the intended and authorized persons! Never send the secret as a parameter to the Checkout Page or Checkout Seamless! If there is any suspicion that the pre-shared key is known to unauthorized persons contact our integration specialists immediately to request the creation and submission of a new secret. A fingerprint is a method to ensure that sensitive parameters and their values sent from the online shop to the hobex Checkout Server and vice versa are not changed by anyone while transferring the data over the Internet. A fingerprint is created by concatenating all parameter values to a string and hashing this string by an HMAC-SHA-512 algorithm using the secret as a cryptographic key. When submitting data from the online shop to hobex Service IT Checkout products the merchant also transmits the fingerprint and the name and order of all parameters used for creating the fingerprint. The hobex Checkout Server then creates the fingerprint of all received parameter values with the specific secret stored in the hobex Checkout Server. If the fingerprint that is sent and the fingerprint computed on the hobex Checkout Server are identical, the values of the parameters transmitted by the merchant were not modified, e.g. during a man-in-the-middle attack. For response fingerprint calculation: if magic_quotes_gpc or magic_quotes_runtime is enabled on the server or in the shop, use slashes to remove unnecessary slashes within the fingerprint seed.

Thousand separators are not permitted. The maximum number of decimal places depends on the selected currency within the currency parameter: Currency Decimal places Euro Maximum of 2 decimal places (100 Cent = 1 Euro). US Dollar Maximum of 2 decimal places (100 Cent = 1 US$). Yen No decimal places allowed. Libyan Dinar Maximum of 3 decimal places (1000 Dirham = 1 Dinar). cancelUrl has to contain the URL of the page where the consumer is forwarded when the payment process is canceled. The consumer should be informed about the cancellation of the payment process and offered possibilities to retry the payment attempt or get in contact with the merchant. cssUrl contains an URL to a CSS file stored on the server and accessible from the Internet. The CSS file is used to adjust the responsive design of Checkout Seamless and Checkout Page. The currency parameter defines the currency used in the payment. By default, only EUR is enabled as currency. If additional currencies are required contact our sales team. Table 1.

The customerId parameter represents the unique ID of the merchant using the hobex Checkout Server. For demo and test mode use the relevant demo and test data. For production mode, the customerId, as well as a secret, will be provided by our integration specialists. The failureUrl parameter defines the URL of the online shop where the consumer is forwarded when the payment process has failed for any reason. On this page, the possibility to retry the payment or get in contact with support team. The language parameter defines the language used for all messages of the Checkout Page and Checkout Seamless that are displayed to the consumer of the online shop. By default, only English and German languages are activated. If the selected language is not supported by the respective financial service provider, the financial service provider decides which language is displayed to the consumer. Table 2.

To save the consumer’s card details for later use, the aforementioned parameter must be set to TRUE. The orderDescription parameter is a description of what the consumer paid for, e.g. a text cross-referencing the order made in the online shop. This text is not transmitted to any financial service provider and is therefore NEVER displayed on any consumer’s invoice or statement. The text is displayed in the QPC Payment Center. If the optional request parameter displayText is not used the orderDescription text will also be visible as consumer information in Checkout Page. The value of orderDescription must not contain any special characters or line breaks. Including such characters causes the fingerprint computation to fail and the error message \"Invalid fingerprint!\" is displayed. The paymentType parameter is the name of the payment method the user selected in the online shop. To use a payment method, it must be purchased by the merchant and enabled by hobex Service IT. If additional payment methods are required, contact our sales team. Value of paymentType parameter Payment method SELECT The consumer may select one of the activated payment methods directly in Checkout Page.

In that case, the communication between the HTML page and the hobex Checkout Server will be done within an iframe where the anonymized payment data are returned to JavaScript objects. The requestFingerprint parameter contains the computed fingerprint based on the values of parameters defined in the requestFingerprintOrder parameter. This method is used for security reasons to verify the parameters the online shop sends to the hobex Checkout Server. At least one of the parameters used for computing the fingerprint needs to be unique to each order to prevent sending the same hash-value! To authenticate, all requests to the hobex Checkout Server need to contain the aforementioned requestFingerprint. To generate the said fingerprint, the HMAC-SHA-512 construction is used by combining the cryptographic hash function SHA-512 with the secret as the cryptographic key to hash the concatenated request parameter values in the order defined in the requestFingerprintOrder. The parameter requestFingerprintOrder needs to contain a comma-separated list of all parameter names, the values of which – and in that exact order — are used to create the fingerprint. The parameter names in the requestFingerprintOrder parameter may be listed in any order, but this exact ordering must be used for the respective parameter values when calculating the fingerprint accordingly, e.g. customerId,amount,currency,language,orderDescription,successUrl,requestFingerprintOrder,secret The serviceUrl parameter is used to define the URL of a web page in an online shop which informs the consumer about the different possibilities to get in contact with the merchant. Do not use this URL to link to the shopping basket of the consumer! If the optional parameter imageUrl is not included, the serviceUrl is not used in the Checkout Page and the consumer has no possibility to access the service page in the online shop during the payment process. The serviceURL has to be accessible over the internet via port 80 or port 443 and may not be hosted on a local server that can’t be accessed by the hobex Checkout Server. The successUrl parameter defines the URL of the online shop where the consumer is forwarded when the payment process has been completed. The additionalMerchantData is a parameter that contains specific data requrired by some acquirer. The allowedCardNetworks parameter handles the useable credit card brands for Google Pay. If the parmeter is not set, all active brands on the customerID will be available. Limit to Amex and Visa only: allowedCardNetworks=AMEX,VISA The autoDeposit parameter enables an automatic deposit and day-end closing of payments. After a consumer has completed payment in online shop, the payment is only approved and not yet deposited. Not deposited (uncaptured) approvals will expire after 7-14 calendar days. The exact deadline depends on the regulations provided by each financial service provider. After exceeding the individual deadline these payments can no longer be submitted or received. Contact our sales team to activate this feature. The backgroundColor parameter defines background color for the HTML pages in the custom CSS for Checkout Page and value is hex-coded RGB e.g. f0f0f0. Background color for the brand image that contains the credit card logos can be set. The confirmMail parameter defines one e-mail address of the merchant for receiving payment details regarding the orders of consumers in the online shop. This e-mail may contain information about payment state, order number, payment method, payment amount and payment currency. hobex Service IT can activate one of the two options: hobex Service IT will send the confirmation to the confirmMail only if the confirmUrl is not available. hobex Service IT will always send the confirmation to the confirmMail in any case. Contact sales team to activate the feature. Table 3. Payment States of the Payment Process SUCCESS The payment has been successfully finished by the consumer. CANCEL The payment process has been canceled by the consumer and has not been successfully finished. FAILURE A problem occurred during the payment process and the payment has not been successfully finished. PENDING The payment is in progress. The merchant can’t be informed about the success or failure of the payment. The confirmUrl defines the URL of online shop that is used by hobex Checkout Server to send the result of the payment process back. For Checkout Page confirmUrl is optional because the same parameters and values are posted to successUrl, failureUrl, cancelUrl or pendingUrl. For Checkout Seamless confirmUrl is required because no return parameters are sent to the successUrl. Use the confirmUrl to save the result of each payment process in the database for later use. Additionally, if consumer does not receive the page of the successUrl, the confirmUrl informs about the result of the payment process anyway. The URL has to be accessible over the Internet via port 80 (HTTP) or port 443 (HTTPS) and may not be hosted on a local server that can’t be accessed by the hobex Checkout Server via the Internet. Also, ensure that firewall configurations allow receiving the confirmation sent via 212.183.46.16/28. For HTTPS communication only TLS can be used, older protocols are not supported. hobex Service IT does not verify whether or not the confirmation was successfully received by the web server. Redelivery attempts can be enabled by our integration specialists, they will set the intervals for redelivery attempts according to the requirements. The intervals are set in minutes, the minimum is one minute, or hours, and the maximum is 99 hours. During times of high load on the hobex Checkout Server, a redelivery attempt may start a bit delayed, however, it will never start before the defined interval. To use this feature, the request parameter confirmUrl has to be sent. Optionally the request parameter confirmMail can be used to send confirmation e-mails individually per transaction. If the confirmation was successfully received, the response will be OK; otherwise, the response will be NOK and a message which specifies the error. Use one of the following three possibilities to configure the response parameters. The following content is possible for HTML comments and plain response: <Checkout Page-CONFIRMATION-RESPONSE result=\"OK|NOK\" message=\"ans..255\"/> Embedded as HTML comment <!--<Checkout Page-CONFIRMATION-RESPONSE result=\"OK\" /> -→ (1) <!--<Checkout Page-CONFIRMATION-RESPONSE result=\"NOK\" message=\"Fingerprint validation failed.\"/> -→ (2) 1 for confirming the successful receipt of our confirmation. 2 for confirming the unsuccessful receipt of our confirmation. Embedded as a plain response <Checkout Page-CONFIRMATION-RESPONSE result=\"OK\" /> (1) <Checkout Page-CONFIRMATION-RESPONSE result=\"NOK\" message=\"Session not found.\" /> (2) 1 for confirming the successful receipt of our confirmation. 2 for confirming the unsuccessful receipt of our confirmation. As JSON response if the header content type is application/JSON {\"status\":\"OK\",\"errorCodes\":null,\"Checkout Page-CONFIRMATION-RESPONSE\":{\"result\": \"OK\"}} (1) {\"status\":\"NOK\",\"errorCodes\":12345,\"Checkout Page-CONFIRMATION-RESPONSE\":{\"result\": \"NOK\",\"message\":\"Session not found.\"}} (2) 1 for confirming the successful receipt of our confirmation. 2 for confirming the unsuccessful receipt of our confirmation. If web server is down for some reason or can’t be accessed by the hobex Checkout Server, the confirmation can’t be delivered to the confirmURL, and no responses may be sent. hobex Service IT will continue to resend the confirmation until receiving the %%result=\"OK\"%% or until the last redelivery attempt was made. In case hobex Service IT has sent a confirmation and no response was received by the time the last redelivery attempt was made, only one final information is sent to the given e-mail address. If the consumer in online shop has terminated a session unexpectedly e.g. closing the browser window, the first confirmation is sent automatically and not earlier than 30 minutes after the request was sent by hobex Service IT. The customerStatement parameter defines a text which is displayed on the bank statement issued to a consumer by the financial service provider. The set of allowed characters and the allowed maximum length depends on the restrictions for payment methods and the corresponding financial service providers. The displayText parameter defines a text which is displayed during the payment process on the Checkout Page. If displayText is not used, the required parameter OrderDescription will be used instead. This text is not transmitted to any financial service provider and is therefore NEVER displayed on any consumer’s invoice or statement. The duplicateRequestCheck parameter checks if the same order has been unintentionally sent more than once by a consumer. The consumer may unintentionally resend the same order by pressing the reload button of the browser because of problems with the internet connection. For this check ensure that the required parameter orderDescription or any other customer parameter used in the fingerprint calculation is different for each order to prevent false-positive detection of duplicate requests. Since for each request, a hash of all parameter values is sent, i.e. the fingerprint, hobex Service IT can easily detect any identical request that has been sent in the last 30 minutes. hobex Service IT can check for duplicate requests, and for that set the value of parameter to “yes”; otherwise, don’t send this parameter. financialInstitution can be used in conjunction with the parameter paymentType, when a specific payment method is selected by the consumer in the online shop. One or more financial institutions can be defined as what is wanted to offer to consumers based on the selected payment method. The individual brands may be listed in any order within the parameter: Allow all brands, force 3-D Secure for brands that support 3-D Secure: financialInstitution=amexsafekey,DinersProtectBuy,DiscoverProtectBuy,MCSC,Maestro,VbV Limit to American Express SafeKey, Mastercard, and Visa 3-D Secure: financialInstitution=amexsafekey,MCSC,VbV Payment method EPS only allows one value, while other payment methods like Credit Card allows a comma-separated list of values.

The imageUrl parameter defines the URL to an image on a web server. The image will be displayed during the payment process on Checkout Page. Image size should have a width of 200 pixels and a height of 100 pixels and the supported image formats are gif, jpg, and png. For security reasons we don’t accept .svg images provided by the customer, so use .png instead. There must be an image available within the given image URL; the loading of Checkout Page will be delayed until a time-out for the missing image occurs. If imageUrl is not used then the required parameter serviceUrl will not be used too. Otherwise, the image will be encapsulated by a link to the serviceUrl, so that the consumer can click on the image to view the HTML page available at the serviceUrl. This URL has to be accessible over the internet https:// and must be accessible by the hobex Checkout Server. javascriptScriptVersion defines the version of the used JavaScript for managing the JavaScript-based communication between the HTML page and the hobex Data Storage. If the parameter is set to pci3, hobex Service IT data storage creates an iFrame that can be integrated into the homepage. If the parameter is not set the javascript fields will be delivered to the to the system. The parameter mandateId defines a two-party mandate between the merchant and the debtor and is required for SEPA Direct Debit payments. The mandate is an agreement giving the merchant permission to debit the consumer’s account for the sum that the two parties agreed upon. Every mandate has an ID provided by the merchant that has to be unique for the creditor. The parameter mandateSignatureDate defines the date on which the above-mentioned mandate was signed by the consumer. The maxRetries parameter defines the maximum number of payment attempts regarding a unique order. Table 13. Value of maxRetries parameter Value Behavior <0 No restriction regarding the number of retries a consumer can do. =0 No retry is possible for the consumer. If an error occurs the consumer will be redirected to the failureUrl. >0 Maximum number of retries the consumer can do before redirecting to the failureUrl. Contact our sales team to activate this feature. With the parameter noScriptInfoURL define the URL to an information page of the online shop which is displayed to the consumer if the web browser of the consumer has JavaScript disabled. This information page within the online shop informs consumers of the requirement to enable JavaScript and a guide on how to do this in the web browser. The orderIdent parameter defines a unique reference to a specific order of a specific consumer within an online shop. This parameter is used within the hobex Service IT Data Storage together with the customerId, shopId and storageId so that only the merchant is able to access the specific session of the hobex Service IT Data Storage. The value of the orderIdent has to be unique for each order of the consumer. Use the same value for initializing the hobex Service IT Data Storage and for initiating the payment process. orderNumber defines a unique ID for the order and when the value of the parameter is set it’s not possible to use that order number for the second time. Even if the consumer could not successfully finalize the payment process, therefore orderNumber can only be used if the parameter maxRetries is set to 0. The feature has to be activated by our sales team, otherwise hobex Service IT is generating the orderNumber. The orderReference parameter defines a unique transaction ID that will be forwarded to the financial institution. The set of allowed characters and the allowed maximum length depends on the restrictions for payment methods and the corresponding financial service providers. paymentToken contains information that is necessary for the front-end initialization of GooglePay Seamless. paymenttypeSortOrder defines the sort order of all displayed payment methods and their corresponding sub-methods if paymentType is set to SELECT. Offer a county-specific sort order by the payment methods with this parameter. The sort order of the payment methods can be set by using a comma-separated list as defined within the parameter paymentType. Also, all available sub-methods can be found within the description of the parameter financialInstitution, and add them to the list. The pendingUrl parameter defines the URL of online shop where a consumer is forwarded when the payment process could not determine a result yet. When using the optional parameter pendingUrl, the use of the parameter confirmUrl is mandatory. The pendingUrl is an optional request parameter for backward compatibility with existing online shops, but use the parameter for handling asynchronous payment methods or payment methods that may have sometimes a delay in returning a final state of a transaction. When the hobex Checkout Server receives a final state from the corresponding financial service provider the information to the confirmUrl will be sent.

This is used if the merchant has multiple online shops or one online shop with multiple configurations within one customerId. The use of shopId has to clarify with the support, so contact integration specialists. The parameter storageId is the unique ID to the hobex Service IT Data Storage of a specific consumer within a specific payment process. The storageId is valid for 30 minutes after the latest use of an initialization, store or read operation on that Data Storage. storageId gets invalid after a successful initiation of the payment process. The transactionIdentifier parameter defines whether a transaction is a single transaction or an initial transaction followed by many subsequent ones. Value SINGLE is a standard singular transaction for which authorization is given once by the consumer to collect only one transaction and value INITIAL for the first transaction of a series of recurring payments. If the parameter transactionIdentifier is used, the configuration setting is overwritten correspondingly, if is not used, the value set in the merchant configuration is used. Currently, the transactionIdentifier may be used for payment methods PayPal and SEPA Direct Debit and it’s required to distinguish between a single transaction or the first transaction with subsequent transaction based on the first one. Backend operation recurPayment may only be carried out if the transactionIdentifier value INITIAL is used. For using the value INITIAL for subsequent recurring transactions, additional approval from the financial service provider needs to be obtained e.g. for PayPal. After receiving approval contact our integration specialists to enable the feature. The windowName parameter defines the name of the pop-up window of iframe where Checkout Page or an additional payment window is opened. windowName is required if the merchant offered payment methods that open an additional pop-up window like eps-Überweisung or PayPal. It ensures a proper return to the checkout process after that payment method-specific pop-up window is closed. The window name must contain uppercase and lowercase letters and underscores, and must not contain any whitespace characters or foreign characters. Opening Checkout Page or Checkout Seamless within a pop-up window may cause problems to the consumers if they have enabled a pop-up blocker within their browsers or it’s activated by default. The parameter creditorId identifies a merchant and allows consumers to manage their mandates with merchants more easily. The parameter dueDate defines the day when payment is debited from the consumer’s bank account.

Table 23. paymentType PAYSAFECARD Possible value(s) of financialInstitution Description PAYSAFECARD PAYSAFECARD The information on the consumer’s country can’t be derived from the delivery address, so they will be taken from the data returned to hobex Service IT by the respective financial service provider. E.g. in the case of credit cards, the country of the credit card issuer is returned and used to determine the consumer’s country. instrumentCountry can be used for payment methods: Credit Card To check the authenticity of the return values sent from the hobex Checkout Server to the online shop, compare the responseFingerprint with a hash of the return values. Create a string by concatenating all returned parameters based on the order in the return parameter responseFingerprintOrder. Then hash the string with an HMAC-SHA-512 algorithm using the secret as cryptographic key and compare the result with the value of the return parameter responseFingerprint. If both values are identical, the response is authentic, i.e. the confirmation was indeed sent by hobex Service IT. If these values are not identical, recheck the calculation and consider that someone compromised the return values or has sent a possibly false confirmation for the payment. Therefore, don’t trust these return values and don’t assume that the payment was made even if it appears that way! To ensure secure communication it’s essential that never disclose or share the secret with persons who are not involved in developing the online shop. Also, never forward the secret via unsecured communication channels e.g. mail, e-mail, fax or instant messaging. When the secret is submitted by fax make sure that the contents of the fax are disclosed only to authorized persons! If the merchant suspect that the secret has been revealed to unauthorized individuals, contact our integration specialists immediately and request a new secret! An ordered list of parameters is used for calculating the fingerprint of the response.","title":"Detailed Description of Parameters","component":"online-guides","version":"main","name":"detailed-description","url":"/parameters/detailed-description/","titles":[{"text":"Request Parameters","hash":"requestParameters","id":1},{"text":"Required Parameters","hash":"requiredParameters","id":2},{"text":"amount","hash":"amount","id":3},{"text":"cancelUrl","hash":"cancelUrl","id":4},{"text":"cssUrl","hash":"cssUrl","id":5},{"text":"currency","hash":"currency","id":6},{"text":"customerId","hash":"customerId","id":7},{"text":"failureUrl","hash":"failureUrl","id":8},{"text":"language","hash":"language","id":9},{"text":"merchantTokenizationFlag","hash":"merchantTokenizationFlag","id":10},{"text":"orderDescription","hash":"orderDescription","id":11},{"text":"paymentType","hash":"paymentType","id":12},{"text":"periodicType","hash":"periodicType","id":13},{"text":"returnUrl","hash":"returnUrl","id":14},{"text":"requestFingerprint","hash":"requestFingerprint","id":15},{"text":"requestFingerprintOrder","hash":"requestFingerprintOrder","id":16},{"text":"serviceUrl","hash":"serviceUrl","id":17},{"text":"successUrl","hash":"successUrl","id":18},{"text":"Optional Parameters","hash":"optionalParameters","id":19},{"text":"additionalMerchantData","hash":"additionalMerchantData","id":20},{"text":"allowedCardNetworks","hash":"allowedCardNetworks","id":21},{"text":"autoDeposit","hash":"autoDeposit","id":22},{"text":"backgroundColor","hash":"backgroundColor","id":23},{"text":"confirmMail","hash":"confirmMail","id":24},{"text":"confirmUrl","hash":"confirmUrl","id":25},{"text":"Confirmation redelivery attempts","hash":"confirmationRedelivery","id":26},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_examples","id":27},{"text":"customerStatement","hash":"customerStatement","id":28},{"text":"displayText","hash":"displayText","id":29},{"text":"duplicateRequestCheck","hash":"duplicateRequestCheck","id":30},{"text":"financialInstitution","hash":"financialInstitution","id":31},{"text":"Values of financialInstitution by paymentType","hash":"valuesFinancialInstitutionRequired","id":32},{"text":"imageUrl","hash":"imageUrl","id":33},{"text":"javascriptScriptVersion","hash":"javascriptScriptVersion","id":34},{"text":"mandateId","hash":"mandateId","id":35},{"text":"mandateSignatureDate","hash":"mandateSignatureDate","id":36},{"text":"maxRetries","hash":"maxRetries","id":37},{"text":"noScriptInfoURL","hash":"noScriptInfoUrl","id":38},{"text":"orderIdent","hash":"orderIdent","id":39},{"text":"orderNumber","hash":"orderNumber","id":40},{"text":"orderReference","hash":"orderReference","id":41},{"text":"paymentToken","hash":"paymentToken","id":42},{"text":"paymenttypeSortOrder","hash":"paymenttypeSortOrder","id":43},{"text":"pendingUrl","hash":"pendingUrl","id":44},{"text":"purchaseInformation","hash":"purchaseInformation","id":45},{"text":"shopId","hash":"shopId","id":46},{"text":"storageId","hash":"storageId","id":47},{"text":"transactionIdentifier","hash":"transactionIdentifier","id":48},{"text":"windowName","hash":"windowName","id":49},{"text":"Response Parameters","hash":"responseParameters","id":50},{"text":"creditorId","hash":"creditorId","id":51},{"text":"dueDate","hash":"dueDate","id":52},{"text":"financialInstitution","hash":"financialInstitutionResponse","id":53},{"text":"Values of financialInstitution by paymentType","hash":"valuesFinancialInstitutionResponse","id":54},{"text":"instrumentCountry","hash":"instrumentCountry","id":55},{"text":"responseFingerprint","hash":"responseFingerprint","id":56},{"text":"responseFingerprintOrder","hash":"responseFingerprintOrder","id":57}]},"21":{"id":21,"text":"Each error code returned by the hobex Checkout Server consists of 5 digits.

European regulatory requirement to combat and reduce fraud and make online payments more secure in every aspect. There are three elements, that must be independent of one another, and have to be considered to verify the identity of the consumer: PIN or password, smartphone, and scan or fingerprint. Supported brands are Mastercard, VISA, American Express, Diners Club, and Discover. It is mandatory to send these optional request parameters for an initial transaction: consumerEmail (or consumerBillingPhone or consumerBillingMobilePhone for Visa Transactions from 12th August 2024) consumerBillingFirstname consumerBillingLastname If \"emerchantpay\" is the chosen acquirer, parameters consumerBillingAddress1, consumerBillingCity, consumerBillingZipCode and consumerBillingCountry must be added. To start the payment process a request must be sent to a specific URL containing 3D Secure 2 request parameters for Checkout Page and Checkout Seamless. One-time payment is a fast way to make a single, non-recurring payment. Every transaction is consumer-initiated, therefore SCA based on PSD2 is required. Each One-click checkout transaction falls under the SCA requirements because it’s executed by the consumer in session. Merchants have to store credit card data as a token in their webshops for recurring payments. The advantage is that consumers can initialize the transaction just in a few steps with data stored in the shop. Every transaction is consumer-initiated so they need to give permission the first time for one-click checkout. In the first request set: consumerEmail (or consumerBillingPhone or consumerBillingMobilePhone for Visa Transactions with 12th August 2024) consumerBillingFirstname consumerBillingLastname consumerChallengeIndicator must be set to 04, merchantTokenizationFlag must be set to true. If \"emerchantpay\" is the chosen acquirer, parameters consumerBillingAddress1, consumerBillingCity, consumerBillingZipCode and consumerBillingCountry must be added. We recommend optional parameters consumerAuthenticationMethod and consumerShippingItemAvailability. If the result is received after the payment is done then the 3DS2 process is completed for the first payment. If the consumer wants to pay again, the checkout has to be initialized again. Set the sourceOrderNumber with the orderNumber value from the previous payment in the new request. If the process is done by Checkout Seamless then don’t refer to any Data Storage session again and proceed to the frontend init. Parameters orderIdent and storageID must not use combined with the parameter sourceOrderNumber. With this model, consumers must be informed regarding the terms of the agreement when setting up the recurring payment plan and the first transaction needs an SCA since transactions are merchant-initiated. In the first request set: consumerEmail (or consumerBillingPhone or consumerBillingMobilePhone for Visa Transactions with 12th August 2024) consumerBillingFirstname consumerBillingLastname consumerChallengeIndicator must be set to 04, merchantTokenizationFlag must be set to true. If \"emerchantpay\" is the chosen acquirer, parameters consumerBillingAddress1, consumerBillingCity, consumerBillingZipCode and consumerBillingCountry must be added. We recommend optional parameters consumerAuthenticationMethod and consumerShippingItemAvailability. If the result is received after the payment is done then the 3DS2 process is completed for the first payment. The merchant has to use the recurPayment backend operation with the sourceOrderNumber, the merchantTokenizationFlag with the value true and the periodicType with the value recurring. The sourceOrderNumber is the orderNumber from the last recurring transaction and if the last transaction was the initial transaction, use this orderNumber for the sourceOrderNumber instead. Unlike the subscription model where recurring payments happen with the same amount on a fixed date, PSD2 has the possibility to execute unscheduled merchant-initiated transactions (UCOF). Merchants have to consider that consumers must be informed regarding the terms of the unscheduled credential on file. The first transaction needs an SCA since transactions are merchant-initiated. In the first request set: consumerEmail (or consumerBillingPhone or consumerBillingMobilePhone for Visa Transactions with 12th August 2024) consumerBillingFirstname consumerBillingLastname consumerChallengeIndicator must be set to 04, merchantTokenizationFlag must be set to true. We recommend optional parameters consumerAuthenticationMethod and consumerShippingItemAvailability. If the result is received after the payment is done then the 3DS2 process is completed for the first payment. The merchant has to use the recurPayment backend operation with the sourceOrderNumber, the merchantTokenizationFlag with the value true and the periodicType with the value ucof. The sourceOrderNumber is the orderNumber from the last recurring transaction and if the last transaction was the initial transaction, use this orderNumber for the sourceOrderNumber instead.","title":"3D Secure 2/Recurring","component":"online-guides","version":"main","name":"3DS","url":"/payment-methods/3DS/","titles":[{"text":"3D Secure 2/Recurring","hash":"3DSecure","id":1},{"text":"3DS2 Use Cases","hash":"3DS2UseCases","id":2},{"text":"One-Time Payment","hash":"oneTimePayment","id":3},{"text":"One-Click Checkout","hash":"oneClickCheckout","id":4},{"text":"Subscription Model","hash":"subscriptionModel","id":5},{"text":"Recurring Payment with Different Amount by Each Payment","hash":"recurringPaymentDifferentAmount","id":6}]},"23":{"id":23,"text":"Visa Click to Pay is only supported by hobex Checkout Page!

The due date is always calculated based on the dispatch date of the goods, not the purchase date. The most common terms of payment are within 14 days after the purchase, which gives shoppers enough time to experience the goods before paying. The full purchase amount is to be paid by the due date.

Riverty offers fixed installment plans with predefined maturities of 3, 6, 12, or 24 months. The Payment API determines which of these installment plans can be offered.

Table 28. Optimierung der Usability Feature Verarbeitete Daten und Datenschutzinfos 1. Individuelles Layout für Checkout Page Das Feature ermöglicht dem Merchant die Gestaltung der Checkout Page im Corporate Design. Die Layoutanpassung erfolgt über vorgefertigtes CSS-Template, das der shopId des Merchants hinterlegt wird. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 2. Zahlungsmittel-Reihenfolge Mit diesem Feature kann der Merchant die Reihenfolge der Zahlungsmittel in der Checkout Page selbst bestimmten. Diese Konfigurationseinstellung erfolgt über den Parameter paymenttypeSortOrder. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 3. Zusätzliche Sprachen Um für jede Transaktion das Bezahlfenster in der für den Endkunden präferierten Sprache anzuzeigen, werden die Spracheinstellungen vom Merchant über den Browser des Endkunden erhoben und Checkout Page durch den Merchant über den Parameter language mitgeteilt. Als personenbezogenes Datum wird somit die Sprache des Endkunden verarbeitet, auch wenn der Endkunde mangels Kenntnis von Personendaten unbekannt bleibt. 4. Zusätzliche Währungen Abhängig vom Produktkatalog des Merchants sind bestimmte Produkte in 1 bis N Währungen zahlbar. Je nach Produkt und Auswahl des Endkunden wird die abzuwickelnde Währung Checkout Page über den Request Parameter currency mitgeteilt. Als personenbezogenes Datum wird somit die Währung der abgewickelten Zahlungstransaktion des Merchants verarbeitet. Table 29. Optimierung interner Prozesse Feature Verarbeitete Daten und Datenschutzinfos 5. Wiederkehrende Zahlung Mit diesem Feature kann der Merchant über die Backend-Operation recurPayment wiederkehrende Zahlungen durchführen. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 6. Weitere Zugänge zum Payment Center Für die Web-Applikationen des Händlerlogins wird ein neuer Zugang für den Merchant angelegt, der nicht personengebunden ist. Für den Zugang ist ein Benutzername und ein Passwort erforderlich. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten.) 7. Rückgabe Karteninhaber Kreditkarte Durch dieses Feature wird das personenbezogene Datum cardholder, also der Karteninhaber der Kreditkarte, dem Merchant übermittelt. 8. Rückgabe Maskierte Kartennummer Kreditkarte Durch dieses Feature wird das personenbezogene Datum maskedPan, also 10 der insgesamt 16 bis 19 Stellen der Kreditkartennummer, dem Merchant übermittelt. 9. Rückgabe Referenznummer der Transaktion Durch dieses Feature erhält der Merchant über den Parameter gatewayReferenceNumber eine eindeutige Referenznummer der Transaktion. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 10. Rückgabe iDEAL Konsumentendaten Durch dieses Feature werden dem Merchant nähere Infos zum Endkunden übermittelt, die alle personenbezogene Daten sind: idealConsumerData. 11. Rückgabe PayPal Konsumentendaten Durch dieses Feature werden dem Merchant nähere Infos zum Endkunden übermittelt, die alle personenbezogene Daten sind: paypalConsumerData. 12. Rückgabe Sofort Konsumentendaten Durch dieses Feature werden dem Merchant nähere Infos zum Endkunden übermittelt, die alle personenbezogene Daten sind: sofortConsumerData. 13. Rückgabe Vertragsnummer, auf welche die Transaktion gelaufen ist Dieses Feature übermittelt über den Parameter gatewayContractNumber die Vertragsnummer des Prozessors / Acquirers des Merchants nach erfolgreicher Zahlung an sein System. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 14. Rückgabe Land des Zahlungsmittels Durch dieses Feature wird dem Merchant das personenbezogene Datum instrumentCountry übermittelt, welches darüber Auskunft gibt, aus welchen Land das für den Endkunden ausgestellte Zahlungsmittel stammt. Der Endkunde selbst bleibt mangels Kenntnis von Personendaten allerdings unbekannt. 15. Rückgabe SEPA Konsumentendaten Durch dieses Feature werden dem Merchant nähere Infos zum Endkunden übermittelt, die alle personenbezogene Daten sind: SepaConsumerData. 16. Rückgabe Address Verification System Daten Kreditkarte Mit diesem Feature werden vom Merchant übermittelte personenbezogene Daten des Endkunden (zB Name, Adresse) auf deren Richtigkeit überprüft und das Ergebnis dieser Überprüfung dem Merchant über avsResponseParameters mitgeteilt. 17. Anzeige einer \"3-D Secure\" Transaktion für Kreditkarte Mit diesem Feature kann der Merchant festlegen, ob dem Endkunden auf der Payment Page ein Hinweis über die Durchführung der Zahlung mittels 3-D Secure Verfahren angezeigt wird. Durch diese Konfigurationseinstellung auf Seiten Checkout Pages kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 18. Rückgabe Ablaufdatum der Kreditkarte Dieses Feature liefert dem Merchant das Ablaufdatum der verwendeten Kreditkarte über den Parameter expiry. Dieses Datum lässt allerdings isoliert keine Rückschlüsse auf Personen zu. 19. Rückgabe der Kreditkartennummer als Hash-Wert Durch dieses Feature wird dem Merchant der Zufallswert hashedPAN übermittelt, der den Merchant erkennen lässt, ob für unterschiedliche Zahlungstransaktionen dieselbe Kreditkartennummer verwendet wurde. Dieses Datum lässt allerdings keine Rückschlüsse auf eine Person zu (z.B. wem gehört die Kreditkartennummer?). 20. Selektive automatische Buchung Über den Parameter autodeposit kann der Merchant für jede Transaktion einzeln bestimmen, wann die Zahlung durchgeführt wird. Dies ist eine Konfigurationseinstellung über einen Schritt, der im Rahmen der Zahlungsabwicklung ohnehin zu erfolgen hat. Der Parameter legt nur den Zeitpunkt dieses Schrittes fest. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 21. Auswahl der Kartenmarke Mit diesem Feature kann der Merchant über den zusätzlich zu übermittelnden Parameter financialInstitution entscheiden, welche Kartentypen zur Zahlung zugelassen werden. Dadurch kommt es jedoch zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 22. Maximale Anzahl an Fehlversuchen Durch dieses Feature kann der Merchant selbstständig die Anzahl an Fehlversuchen für eine Zahlung festlegen. Diese Konfigurationseinstellung erfolgt über den Parameter maxRetries. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 23. Eigene Auftragsnummer Zu Zwecke organisatorischer Erleichterung kann der Merchant über den Parameter orderNumber jede Transaktion eindeutig zuordnen. Rückschlüsse auf Personen sind dadurch jedoch nicht möglich. 24. Erweiterung der Checkout Page zur Backoffice Nutzung Durch dieses Feature wird der Merchant in die Lage versetzt, das Produkt wie ein Endkunde zu nutzen. Eine weitere Verarbeitung von Datenkategorien ergibt sich dadurch jedoch nicht. Table 30. Sicherheitsfeatures Feature Verarbeitete Daten und Datenschutzinfos 25. Zustellung der Zahlungsbenachrichtigung per E-Mail Durch dieses Feature erhält der Merchant sämtliche Response Parameter, die er ansonsten über die confirmUrl erhält, im Email-Format sowie an die gewünschte Email-Adresse. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. Die entsprechenden Response Informationen sind hier ersichtlich. 26. Wiederholte Zustellversuche der Zahlungsbenachrichtigung Für den Fall, dass der Server des Merchants nicht erreichbar sein sollte, ermöglicht dieses Feature die erneute Zustellung der Zahlungsbenachrichtigung. Diese Konfigurationseinstellung bewirkt jedoch keine zusätzliche Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. /** * Find all payment methods, return array of objects which contain name and class identifier * @return {Array} Array filled with Objects containing name and classname */ function paymentMethods() { let struct = {}; let cats = document.querySelectorAll('.datapriv'); let pms = Array.from(cats).filter(c => c.nodeName.toLowerCase() == 'h3'); pms.forEach(pm => { let classname = Array.from(pm.classList).filter(c => c.startsWith('cat_')).shift().toString().substr(4); if (pm.innerText && pm.id && classname) { struct[classname] = { name: pm.innerText, id: pm.id }; } }); return struct; } /** * Fills payment method selection with all pm's found on the page */ function fillDropDown(pms) { pmPicker = document.getElementById('pmpicker'); Object.entries(pms).forEach(pm => { let o = document.createElement('option'); o.text = pm[1].name; o.value = pm[0]; pmPicker.appendChild(o); }); pmPicker.addEventListener('change', function () { document.querySelectorAll('.datapriv').forEach(e => { e.style.display = 'none'; }); document.querySelectorAll('.cat_' + pmPicker.value).forEach(e => { e.style.display = 'block'; }); // disabled because these items no longer appear in menu-toc after restructuring // // Hide hidden entries from Menu-Toc // Object.entries(pms).map((pm) => {return pm[1].id}).forEach((href) => { // document.querySelector('div.toc-menu > ul > li > a[href=\"#' + href + '\"]').parentElement.style.display = 'none'; // }); // // Show currently selected to Menu-Toc // Object.entries(pms).forEach((pm) => { // if(pm[0] == pmPicker.value) { // document.querySelector('div.toc-menu > ul > li > a[href=\"#' + pm[1].id + '\"]').parentElement.style.display = 'block'; // } // }); }); pmPicker.selectedIndex = 0; pmPicker.dispatchEvent(new Event('change')); } document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function (event) { let pms = paymentMethods(); if (typeof pms == 'object') { fillDropDown(pms); } });","title":"Datenschutzinfo für Checkout Page","component":"online-guides","version":"main","name":"protection-personal-data-page-de","url":"/protection-personal-data/protection-personal-data-page-de/","titles":[{"text":"Datenschutzinfo für Checkout Page","hash":"datenschutzinfoFrPage","id":1},{"text":"Basisprodukt","hash":"Basisprodukt","id":2},{"text":"Auswahl Zahlungsmittel","hash":"Auswahl","id":3},{"text":"Kreditkarte","hash":"Kreditkarte","id":4},{"text":"eps-Überweisung","hash":"eps","id":5},{"text":"Giropay","hash":"giropay","id":6},{"text":"Przelewy24","hash":"P24","id":7},{"text":"Sofort","hash":"Sofort","id":8},{"text":"Paysafecard","hash":"Paysafecard","id":9},{"text":"Invoice by Payolution","hash":"Invoice_Payolution","id":10},{"text":"SEPA Direct Debit by Hobex","hash":"SEPA_DD_Hobex","id":11},{"text":"SEPA Direct Debit by b4Payment","hash":"SEPA_DD_B4Payment","id":12},{"text":"Zusatzfeatures","hash":"Zusatzfeatures","id":13}]},"64":{"id":64,"text":"This chapter provides information on all data that are processed by our solution Checkout Page.

All parameters indicated for the respective feature need to be processed to ensure our solution meets the contractual obligations to the merchant (purpose of the processing of data). Table 28. Optimization of Usability Feature Processing of data and information on the protection of personal data 1. Customizable layout for Checkout Page This feature allows the merchant to align Checkout Page with a given corporate design. The layout adaptation is carried out via a predefined CSS-Template, which is assigned to the merchant’s shopId. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 2. Payment method sort order This feature allows the merchant to define the sort order of the payment methods offered in Checkout Page. This configuration setting is done via parameter paymenttypeSortOrder. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 3. Additional languages In order to display the payment window in the language preferred by the consumer, the merchant retrieves the consumer browser language settings, which are forwarded to hobex Service IT via parameter language. Thus, processing of personal data involves the consumer’s language, although the consumer remains unknown because the personal data are not known. 4. Additional currencies Depending on the merchant’s product portfolio, certain products may be paid in 1 to N currencies. Depending on the product and consumer’s choice, hobex Service IT is informed on the currency via parameter currency. Thus, processing of personal data involves the currency of the merchant’s processed payment transaction. Table 29. Optimization of Internal Processes Feature Processing of data and information on the protection of personal data 5. Recurring payment This feature allows the merchant to carry out recurring payments via parameter recurPayment. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 6. Additional access to the Payment Center For the web application of the link:https://hobex Service IT.at/haendler-login/[Merchant Login,window=\\\"_blank\\\"] a new access is set up which does not involve any personal data. A username and password are required for the access. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 7. This feature involves the processing of personal data, i.e. cardholder as the card holder information is sent to the merchant. 8. Return of masked credit card number This feature involves the processing of personal data, i.e. maskedPan as 10 of a total of 16 to 19 digits of the credit card number are sent to the merchant. 9. Return of transaction reference number This feature allows the merchant to obtain a unique reference number of the transaction via parameter gatewayReferenceNumber. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 10. Return of iDEAL consumer data This feature allows the merchant to obtain detailed information on the consumer, all of which are considered personal data: idealConsumerData. 11. Return of PayPal consumer data This feature allows the merchant to obtain detailed information on the consumer, all of which are considered personal data: paypalConsumerData. 12. Return of Sofort. consumer data This feature allows the merchant to obtain detailed information on the consumer, all of which are considered personal data: sofortConsumerData. 13. Return of contract number associated with transaction This feature allows the merchant’s system to obtain the contract number of the processor/acquirer via parameter gatewayContractNumber. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 14. Return of instrument country This feature allows the merchant to obtain personal data on the country in which the consumer’s payment method was issued via parameter instrumentCountry. However, the consumer remains unknown because the personal data are not known. 15. Return of SEPA consumer data This feature allows the merchant to obtain detailed information on the consumer, all of which are considered personal data: SepaConsumerData. 16. This feature allows to verify consumer-specific personal data (name, address, etc.), which were forwarded by the merchant, and to inform the merchant of the verification result avsResponseParameters. 17. Display of 3-D Secure transaction for credit card This feature allows the merchant to display to the consumer information regarding 3-D Secure transaction for the relevant payment on the payment page. This configuration setting on part of Checkout Page does not imply any additional processing of personal data. 18. Return of credit card expiration date This feature allows the merchant to obtain the expiration date of the used credit card via parameter expiry. However, this mere date does not permit any conclusions to be drawn as to the person it relates. 19. Return of hashed credit card number This feature allows the merchant to obtain the random value hashedPAN, which provides information as to whether the same credit card number has been used for different payment transactions. However, these data don’t permit any conclusions to be drawn as to the person they relate, e.g. card holder. 20. Selective automatic deposit Via parameter autodeposit the merchant may define the time of deposit for each individual transaction. This is a configuration setting relating to a decision which has to be made anyway during payment processing. The parameter only defines the time of deposit. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 21. Selection of credit card brand This feature allows the merchant to define via the additional parameter financialInstitution which card brands are allowed for payment. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 22. Maximum number of unsuccessful payment attempts This feature allows the merchant to define the permitted number of unsuccessful payment attempts. This configuration setting is done via parameter maxRetries. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 23. Unique order number The parameter orderNumber allows the merchant to unequivocally assign each transaction in order to fulfill organizational requirements. However, these data don’t permit any conclusions to be drawn as to the person they relate. 24. Extension of Checkout Page for back office use This feature allows the merchant to trigger payment instead of the consumer. However, no further processing of data categories takes place. Table 30. Security Features Feature Processing of data and information on the protection of personal data 25. Confirmation notification by e-mail This feature allows the merchant to obtain, via e-mail sent to the specified e-mail address, all response parameters that would otherwise be received via the confirmUrl. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. To view the respective response information click confirmUrl. 26. Confirmation notification re-delivery attempts If the merchant’s server is not accessible, this feature allows several re-delivery attempts in order to send the confirmation notification. However, this configuration setting does not imply any additional processing of personal data. /** * Find all payment methods, return array of objects which contain name and class identifier * @return {Array} Array filled with Objects containing name and classname */ function paymentMethods() { let struct = {}; let cats = document.querySelectorAll('.datapriv'); let pms = Array.from(cats).filter(c => c.nodeName.toLowerCase() == 'h3'); pms.forEach(pm => { let classname = Array.from(pm.classList).filter(c => c.startsWith('cat_')).shift().toString().substr(4); if (pm.innerText && pm.id && classname) { struct[classname] = { name: pm.innerText, id: pm.id }; } }); return struct; } /** * Fills payment method selection with all pm's found on the page */ function fillDropDown(pms) { pmPicker = document.getElementById('pmpicker'); Object.entries(pms).forEach(pm => { let o = document.createElement('option'); o.text = pm[1].name; o.value = pm[0]; pmPicker.appendChild(o); }); pmPicker.addEventListener('change', function () { document.querySelectorAll('.datapriv').forEach(e => { e.style.display = 'none'; }); document.querySelectorAll('.cat_' + pmPicker.value).forEach(e => { e.style.display = 'block'; }); // disabled because these items no longer appear in menu-toc after restructuring // // Hide hidden entries from Menu-Toc // Object.entries(pms).map((pm) => {return pm[1].id}).forEach((href) => { // document.querySelector('div.toc-menu > ul > li > a[href=\"#' + href + '\"]').parentElement.style.display = 'none'; // }); // // Show currently selected to Menu-Toc // Object.entries(pms).forEach((pm) => { // if(pm[0] == pmPicker.value) { // document.querySelector('div.toc-menu > ul > li > a[href=\"#' + pm[1].id + '\"]').parentElement.style.display = 'block'; // } // }); }); pmPicker.selectedIndex = 0; pmPicker.dispatchEvent(new Event('change')); } document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function (event) { let pms = paymentMethods(); if (typeof pms == 'object') { fillDropDown(pms); } });","title":"Information on the protection of personal data for Checkout Page","component":"online-guides","version":"main","name":"protection-personal-data-page-en","url":"/protection-personal-data/protection-personal-data-page-en/","titles":[{"text":"Information on the Protection of Personal Data for Checkout Page","hash":"protectionPersonalDataPage","id":1},{"text":"Basic Solution","hash":"basicSolution","id":2},{"text":"Select payment method","hash":"select","id":3},{"text":"Credit Card","hash":"Kreditkarte","id":4},{"text":"eps-Überweisung","hash":"eps","id":5},{"text":"Giropay","hash":"giropay","id":6},{"text":"Przelewy24","hash":"P24","id":7},{"text":"Sofort","hash":"Sofort","id":8},{"text":"Paysafecard","hash":"Paysafecard","id":9},{"text":"Invoice by Payolution","hash":"Invoice_Payolution","id":10},{"text":"SEPA Direct Debit by Hobex","hash":"SEPA_DD_Hobex","id":11},{"text":"SEPA Direct Debit by b4Payment","hash":"SEPA_DD_B4Payment","id":12},{"text":"Additional Features","hash":"additionalFeatures","id":13}]},"65":{"id":65,"text":"Auf dieser Infoseite können Sie sich über alle Daten informieren, die das Produkt Checkout Seamlessverarbeitet.

Table 28. Inklusivleistungen Inklusivleistung Verarbeitete Daten und Datenschutzinfos 1. Rückgabe Karteninhaber Kreditkarte Durch dieses Feature wird das personenbezogene Datum cardholder, also der Karteninhaber der Kreditkarte, dem Merchant übermittelt. 2. Rückgabe Maskierte Kartennummer Kreditkarte Durch dieses Feature wird das personenbezogene Datum maskedPan, also 10 der insgesamt 16 bis 19 Stellen der Kreditkartennummer, dem Merchant übermittelt. 3. Rückgabe Referenznummer der Transaktion Durch dieses Feature erhält der Merchant über den Parameter gatewayReferenceNumber eine eindeutige Referenznummer der Transaktion. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 4. Rückgabe iDEAL Konsumentendaten Durch dieses Feature werden dem Merchant nähere Infos zum Endkunden übermittelt, die alle personenbezogene Daten sind: idealConsumerData. 5. Rückgabe PayPal Konsumentendaten Durch dieses Feature werden dem Merchant nähere Infos zum Endkunden übermittelt, die alle personenbezogene Daten sind: paypalConsumerData. 6. Rückgabe Vertragsnummer, auf welche die Transaktion gelaufen ist Dieses Feature übermittelt über den Parameter gatewayContractNumber die Vertragsnummer des Prozessors / Acquirers des Merchants nach erfolgreicher Zahlung an sein System. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 7. Rückgabe Sofort Konsumentendaten Durch dieses Feature werden dem Merchant nähere Infos zum Endkunden übermittelt, die alle personenbezogene Daten sind: sofortConsumerData. 8. Rückgabe SEPA Konsumentendaten Durch dieses Feature werden dem Merchant nähere Infos zum Endkunden übermittelt, die alle personenbezogene Daten sind: SepaConsumerData. 9. Rückgabe Ablaufdatum der Kreditkarte Dieses Feature liefert dem Merchant das Ablaufdatum der verwendeten Kreditkarte über den Parameter expiry. Dieses Datum lässt allerdings isoliert keine Rückschlüsse auf Personen zu. 10. Selektive automatische Buchung Über den Parameter #autodeposit kann der Merchant für jede Transaktion einzeln bestimmen, wann die Zahlung durchgeführt wird. Dies ist eine Konfigurationseinstellung über einen Schritt, der im Rahmen der Zahlungsabwicklung ohnehin zu erfolgen hat. Der Parameter legt nur den Zeitpunkt dieses Schrittes fest. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 11. Auswahl der Kartenmarke Mit diesem Feature kann der Merchant über den zusätzlich zu übermittelnden Parameter financialInstitution entscheiden, welche Kartentypen zur Zahlung zugelassen werden. Dadurch kommt es jedoch zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 12. Eigene Auftragsnummer Zu Zwecke organisatorischer Erleichterung kann der Merchant über den Parameter orderNumber jede Transaktion eindeutig zuordnen. Rückschlüsse auf Personen sind dadurch jedoch nicht möglich. Für jedes zusätzlich zum Basisprodukt Checkout Seamless bestellte Feature ist hier ersichtlich, welche Daten das jeweilige Feature verarbeitet. Sämtliche für das jeweilige Feature angegebenen Parameter müssen verarbeitet werden, um dem Merchant zusätzlich zum Basisprodukt das gewünschte Feature zur Verfügung stellen zu können (Zweck der Datenverarbeitung). Table 29. Optimierung der Usability Feature Verarbeitete Daten und Datenschutzinfos 1. Individuelles Layout für Checkout Seamless Das Feature ermöglicht dem Merchant die Gestaltung von Checkout Seamless im Corporate Design. Die Layoutanpassung erfolgt über vorgefertigtes CSS-Template, das der shopId des Merchants hinterlegt wird. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 2. Zusätzliche Sprachen Um für jede Transaktion das Bezahlfenster in der für den Endkunden präferierten Sprache anzuzeigen, werden die Spracheinstellungen vom Merchant über den Browser des Endkunden erhoben und hobex Service IT durch den Merchant über den Parameter language mitgeteilt. Als personenbezogenes Datum wird somit die Sprache des Endkunden verarbeitet, auch wenn der Endkunde mangels Kenntnis von Personendaten unbekannt bleibt. 3. Zusätzliche Währungen Abhängig vom Produktkatalog des Merchants sind bestimmte Produkte in 1 bis N Währungen zahlbar. Je nach Produkt und Auswahl des Endkunden wird die abzuwickelnde Währung hobex Service IT über den Request Parameter currency mitgeteilt. Als personenbezogenes Datum wird somit die Währung der abgewickelten Zahlungstransaktion des Merchants verarbeitet. Table 30. Optimierung interner Prozesse Feature Verarbeitete Daten und Datenschutzinfos 4. Wiederkehrende Zahlung Mit diesem Feature kann der Merchant über die Backend-Operation recurPayment wiederkehrende Zahlungen durchführen. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. 5. Weitere Zugänge zum Payment Center Für die Web-Applikationen des Händlerlogins wird ein neuer Zugang für den Merchant angelegt, der nicht personengebunden ist. Für den Zugang ist ein Benutzername und ein Passwort erforderlich. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten.) 6. Rückgabe der Kreditkartennummer als Hash-Wert Durch dieses Feature wird dem Merchant der Zufallswert hashedPan übermittelt, der den Merchant erkennen lässt, ob für unterschiedliche Zahlungstransaktionen dieselbe Kreditkartennummer verwendet wurde. Dieses Datum lässt allerdings keine Rückschlüsse auf eine Person zu (z.B. wem gehört die Kreditkartennummer?). 7. Erweiterung für Checkout Seamless zur Backoffice Nutzung Durch dieses Feature wird der Merchant in die Lage versetzt, das Produkt wie ein Endkunde zu nutzen. Eine weitere Verarbeitung von Datenkategorien ergibt sich dadurch jedoch nicht. Table 31. Sicherheitsfeatures Feature Verarbeitete Daten und Datenschutzinfos 8. Zustellung der Zahlungsbenachrichtigung per E-Mail Durch dieses Feature erhält der Merchant sämtliche Response Parameter, die er ansonsten über die confirmUrl erhält, im Email-Format sowie an die gewünschte Email-Adresse. Dadurch kommt es zu keiner zusätzlichen Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. Die entsprechenden Response Informationen sind hier ersichtlich. 9. Wiederholte Zustellversuche der Zahlungsbenachrichtigung Für den Fall, dass der Server des Merchants nicht erreichbar sein sollte, ermöglicht dieses Feature die erneute Zustellung der Zahlungsbenachrichtigung. Diese Konfigurationseinstellung bewirkt jedoch keine zusätzliche Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten. /** * Find all payment methods, return array of objects which contain name and class identifier * @return {Array} Array filled with Objects containing name and classname */ function paymentMethods() { let struct = {}; let cats = document.querySelectorAll('.datapriv'); let pms = Array.from(cats).filter(c => c.nodeName.toLowerCase() == 'h3'); pms.forEach(pm => { let classname = Array.from(pm.classList).filter(c => c.startsWith('cat_')).shift().toString().substr(4); if (pm.innerText && pm.id && classname) { struct[classname] = { name: pm.innerText, id: pm.id }; } }); return struct; } /** * Fills payment method selection with all pm's found on the page */ function fillDropDown(pms) { pmPicker = document.getElementById('pmpicker'); Object.entries(pms).forEach(pm => { let o = document.createElement('option'); o.text = pm[1].name; o.value = pm[0]; pmPicker.appendChild(o); }); pmPicker.addEventListener('change', function () { document.querySelectorAll('.datapriv').forEach(e => { e.style.display = 'none'; }); document.querySelectorAll('.cat_' + pmPicker.value).forEach(e => { e.style.display = 'block'; }); // disabled because these items no longer appear in menu-toc after restructuring // // Hide hidden entries from Menu-Toc // Object.entries(pms).map((pm) => {return pm[1].id}).forEach((href) => { // document.querySelector('div.toc-menu > ul > li > a[href=\"#' + href + '\"]').parentElement.style.display = 'none'; // }); // // Show currently selected to Menu-Toc // Object.entries(pms).forEach((pm) => { // if(pm[0] == pmPicker.value) { // document.querySelector('div.toc-menu > ul > li > a[href=\"#' + pm[1].id + '\"]').parentElement.style.display = 'block'; // } // }); }); pmPicker.selectedIndex = 0; pmPicker.dispatchEvent(new Event('change')); } document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function (event) { let pms = paymentMethods(); if (typeof pms == 'object') { fillDropDown(pms); } });","title":"Datenschutzinfo für Checkout Seamless","component":"online-guides","version":"main","name":"protection-personal-data-seamless-de","url":"/protection-personal-data/protection-personal-data-seamless-de/","titles":[{"text":"Datenschutzinfo für Checkout Seamless","hash":"datenschutzinfoFürSeamless","id":1},{"text":"Basisprodukt","hash":"basisprodukt","id":2},{"text":"Datenverarbeitung je Zahlungsmittel","hash":"datenverarbeitungJeZahlungsmittel","id":3},{"text":"Auswahl Zahlungsmittel","hash":"auswahl","id":4},{"text":"Credit Card","hash":"Kreditkarte","id":5},{"text":"eps-Überweisung","hash":"eps","id":6},{"text":"Giropay","hash":"giropay","id":7},{"text":"Przelewy24","hash":"P24","id":8},{"text":"Sofort","hash":"Sofort","id":9},{"text":"Paysafecard","hash":"Paysafecard","id":10},{"text":"Invoice by Payolution","hash":"Invoice_Payolution","id":11},{"text":"SEPA Direct Debit by Hobex","hash":"SEPA_DD_Hobex","id":12},{"text":"SEPA Direct Debit by b4Payment","hash":"SEPA_DD_B4Payment","id":13},{"text":"Inklusivleistungen","hash":"inklusivleistungen","id":14},{"text":"Zusatzfeatures","hash":"Zusatzfeatures","id":15}]},"66":{"id":66,"text":"This chapter provides information on all data that are processed by our solution Checkout Seamless.

Table 28. Included Services Feature Processing of data and information on the protection of personal data 1. Return of card holder This feature involves the processing of personal data, i.e. cardholder as the card holder information is sent to the merchant. 2. Return of masked credit card number This feature involves the processing of personal data, i.e. maskedPan as 10 of a total of 16 to 19 digits of the credit card number are sent to the merchant. 3. Return of transaction reference number This feature allows the merchant to obtain a unique reference number of the transaction via parameter gatewayReferenceNumber. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 4. Return of iDEAL consumer data This feature allows the merchant to obtain detailed information on the consumer, all of which are considered personal data: idealConsumerData. 5. Return of PayPal consumer data This feature allows the merchant to obtain detailed information on the consumer, all of which are considered personal data: paypalConsumerData. 6. Return of contract number associated with transaction This feature allows the merchant’s system to obtain the contract number of the processor/acquirer via parameter gatewayContractNumber. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 7. Return of Sofort. consumer data This feature allows the merchant to obtain detailed information on the consumer, all of which are considered personal data: sofortConsumerData. 8. Return of SEPA consumer data This feature allows the merchant to obtain detailed information on the consumer, all of which are considered personal data: SepaConsumerData. 9. Return of credit card expiration date This feature allows the merchant to obtain the expiration date of the used credit card via parameter expiry. However, this mere date does not permit any conclusions to be drawn as to the person it relates. 10. Selective automatic deposit Via parameter autodeposit the merchant may define the time of deposit for each individual transaction. This is a configuration setting relating to a decision which has to be made anyway during payment processing. The parameter only defines the time of deposit. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 11. Selection of credit card brand This feature allows the merchant to define via the additional parameter financialInstitution which card brands are allowed for payment. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 12. Unique order number The parameter orderNumber allows the merchant to unequivocally assign each transaction in order to fulfill organizational requirements. However, these data don’t permit any conclusions to be drawn as to the person they relate. This chapter provides information on the data processed for each feature that has been added to the basic Checkout Seamless solution. All parameters indicated for the respective feature need to be processed to ensure our solution meets the contractual obligations to the merchant (purpose of the processing of data). Table 29. Optimization of Usability Feature Processing of data and information on the protection of personal data 1. Customizable layout for Checkout Seamless This feature allows the merchant to align Checkout Page with a given corporate design. The layout adaptation is carried out via a predefined CSS-Template, which is assigned to the merchant’s shopId. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 2. Additional languages In order to display the payment window in the language preferred by the consumer, the merchant retrieves the consumer browser language settings, which are forwarded to hobex Service IT via parameter language. Thus, processing of personal data involves the consumer’s language, although the consumer remains unknown because the personal data are not known. 3. Additional currencies Depending on the merchant’s product portfolio, certain products may be paid in 1 to N currencies. Depending on the product and consumer’s choice, hobex Service IT is informed on the currency via parameter currency. Thus, processing of personal data involves the currency of the merchant’s processed payment transaction. Table 30. Optimization of Internal Processes Feature Processing of data and information on the protection of personal data 4. Recurring payment This feature allows the merchant to carry out recurring payments via parameter recurPayment. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 5. Additional access to the Payment Center For the web application of the link:https://hobex Service IT.at/haendler-login/[Merchant Login,window=\\\"_blank\\\"] a new access is set up which does not involve any personal data. A username and password are required for the access. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. 6. Return of masked credit card number This feature involves the processing of personal data, i.e. maskedPan as 10 of a total of 16 to 19 digits of the credit card number are sent to the merchant. 7. Extension of Checkout Seamless for back office use This feature allows the merchant to trigger payment instead of the consumer. However, no further processing of data categories takes place. Table 31. Security Features Feature Processing of data and information on the protection of personal data 8. Confirmation notification by e-mail This feature allows the merchant to obtain, via e-mail sent to the specified e-mail address, all response parameters that would otherwise be received via the confirmUrl. Thus, no additional processing of personal data takes place. To view the respective response information click confirmUrl. 9. Confirmation notification re-delivery attempts If the merchant’s server is not accessible, this feature allows several re-delivery attempts in order to send the confirmation notification. However, this configuration setting does not imply any additional processing of personal data. /** * Find all payment methods, return array of objects which contain name and class identifier * @return {Array} Array filled with Objects containing name and classname */ function paymentMethods() { let struct = {}; let cats = document.querySelectorAll('.datapriv'); let pms = Array.from(cats).filter(c => c.nodeName.toLowerCase() == 'h3'); pms.forEach(pm => { let classname = Array.from(pm.classList).filter(c => c.startsWith('cat_')).shift().toString().substr(4); if (pm.innerText && pm.id && classname) { struct[classname] = { name: pm.innerText, id: pm.id }; } }); return struct; } /** * Fills payment method selection with all pm's found on the page */ function fillDropDown(pms) { pmPicker = document.getElementById('pmpicker'); Object.entries(pms).forEach(pm => { let o = document.createElement('option'); o.text = pm[1].name; o.value = pm[0]; pmPicker.appendChild(o); }); pmPicker.addEventListener('change', function () { document.querySelectorAll('.datapriv').forEach(e => { e.style.display = 'none'; }); document.querySelectorAll('.cat_' + pmPicker.value).forEach(e => { e.style.display = 'block'; }); // disabled because these items no longer appear in menu-toc after restructuring // // Hide hidden entries from Menu-Toc // Object.entries(pms).map((pm) => {return pm[1].id}).forEach((href) => { // document.querySelector('div.toc-menu > ul > li > a[href=\"#' + href + '\"]').parentElement.style.display = 'none'; // }); // // Show currently selected to Menu-Toc // Object.entries(pms).forEach((pm) => { // if(pm[0] == pmPicker.value) { // document.querySelector('div.toc-menu > ul > li > a[href=\"#' + pm[1].id + '\"]').parentElement.style.display = 'block'; // } // }); }); pmPicker.selectedIndex = 0; pmPicker.dispatchEvent(new Event('change')); } document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function (event) { let pms = paymentMethods(); if (typeof pms == 'object') { fillDropDown(pms); } });","title":"Information on the protection of personal data for Checkout Seamless","component":"online-guides","version":"main","name":"protection-personal-data-seamless-en","url":"/protection-personal-data/protection-personal-data-seamless-en/","titles":[{"text":"Information on the Protection of Personal Data for Checkout Seamless","hash":"protectionPersonalDataSeamless","id":1},{"text":"Basic Solution","hash":"basicSolution","id":2},{"text":"Data processing according to payment method","hash":"dataProcessingAccordingToPaymentMethod","id":3},{"text":"Select Payment Method","hash":"select","id":4},{"text":"Credit Card","hash":"Kreditkarte","id":5},{"text":"eps-Überweisung","hash":"eps","id":6},{"text":"Giropay","hash":"giropay","id":7},{"text":"Przelewy24","hash":"P24","id":8},{"text":"Sofort","hash":"Sofort","id":9},{"text":"Paysafecard","hash":"Paysafecard","id":10},{"text":"Invoice by Payolution","hash":"Invoice_Payolution","id":11},{"text":"SEPA Direct Debit by Hobex","hash":"SEPA_DD_Hobex","id":12},{"text":"SEPA Direct Debit by b4Payment","hash":"SEPA_DD_B4Payment","id":13},{"text":"Included Services","hash":"includedServices","id":14},{"text":"Additional Features","hash":"additionalFeatures","id":15}]},"67":{"id":67,"text":"Auf dieser Infoseite können Sie sich über alle Daten informieren, die das Produkt Checkout Terminal verarbeitet.

The payment details of the consumers are prepared in tabular format, uploaded, and automatically processed. Here is a demo access for testing purposes. The merchant needs to create a transaction file that includes all necessary payment data. It must be converted into a tab-delimited text file (image example below) since otherwise the transactions can’t be uploaded. After successful login, Checkout Automated opens and the merchant selects and uploads the relevant file which is then automatically processed. Example of an xls file to upload in Checkout Automated: request example. Defining the file format The max. number of uploaded transactions must not exceed 3000 transactions per file, the max. file size must not exceed 2 MB. Before uploading the file remember to convert the xls file into a tab-delimited text file since otherwise the transactions are not recognized and not uploaded. If the consumer is a company instead of a private person, enter Firma or Fa in the column \"First name\" and the relevant company’s name in the column \"Last name\".

Payment details: The consumer’s credit card details: credit card number and expiration date (the card security code is not necessary). If the payment has been completed successfully, the message Transaction approved appears. If the credit card payment has been successfully processed, approval for the payment amount is displayed in the Payment Center. But completed payments are not automatically deposited via Checkout Terminal, so to receive the outstanding amounts the approved amounts need to be deposited in the Payment Center. hobex Service IT carries out the deposit of approved payments and there are two configuration options: Daily fully automated deposit of all payments-all payments are deposited once during the night. Immediate capture-after affecting a payment, the payment is available immediately as a capture. Not deposited approvals will expire after 7-14 calendar days and after exceeding the individual deadline these payments can no longer be submitted or received. Steps for carrying out a payment using SEPA Direct Debit. Order details: After completing the fields the merchant selects payment method > SEPA Direct Debit. Payment details: The consumer’s bank details: account owner, IBAN, BIC,mandate reference, mandate signature date and due date. If the payment has been completed successfully, the message \"Transaction approved\" appears in the window that opens Order confirmation. At the same time, a unique order number is created automatically. Steps for recurring payment: Order details: After completing the fields the merchant selects payment method > Recurring payment. Payment details: Recurring payment details: Source order number: original order number. Enter the order number to which the recurring payment refers. A window opens and shows a summary of the source order data > Next. If the payment has been completed successfully, the message Transaction approved appears in the window Order confirmation. At the same time, a unique order number is issued automatically. Generally, payment for the source order number must not be older than 400 days for credit card payments. If the order is older than 400 days, the error message \"Card number missing\" is displayed. If the expiration date of the credit card of the stored source order was exceeded, the error message \"Expiration date is invalid\" is displayed. In both error cases, obtain the new credit card details from the consumer and initiate a new order since a recurring payment may not be carried out. There are currently no restrictions on payments using SEPA Direct Debit procedures.","title":"Checkout Terminal","component":"online-guides","version":"main","name":"terminal","url":"/web-based/terminal/","titles":[{"text":"Checkout Terminal","hash":"checkoutTerminal","id":1},{"text":"Using Checkout Terminal","hash":"terminalManual","id":2},{"text":"Logging in to the Checkout Terminal interface","hash":"loginTerminal","id":3},{"text":"Completing payment with Credit Card","hash":"completingPaymentCreditCard","id":4},{"text":"Step 1","hash":"step1CreditCard","id":5},{"text":"Step 2","hash":"step2CreditCard","id":6},{"text":"Completing payment with SEPA Direct Debit","hash":"completingPaymentSEPA","id":7},{"text":"Step 1","hash":"step1SEPA","id":8},{"text":"Step 2","hash":"step2SEPA","id":9},{"text":"Effecting a recurring payment","hash":"recurring","id":10},{"text":"Step 1","hash":"step1Recurring","id":11},{"text":"Step 2","hash":"step2Recurring","id":12}]},"74":{"id":74,"text":"If the default design and layout of Checkout Page do not fit the design and layout of the online shop, there are different possibilities to modify the design.

Alternatively (to points 1 and 2), the payment method SELECT can be displayed in the online store, in which case the payment method is selected directly on the checkout page. The online shop redirects the consumer to Checkout Page hosted on the hobex Checkout Server. Checkout Page displays an input form for entering payment data such as credit card number, expiration date, etc. to the consumer, and/or redirects the consumer to the financial service provider. The consumer enters the required sensitive payment data into an input form and commits the payment by clicking a relevant button. Checkout Page processes the payment and interacts directly with the consumer and the financial service provider. Checkout Page informs the online shop about the result of the payment. Then the online shop stores the result of the payment and triggers a manual or automated shipping process to send the purchased items to the consumer. The online shop verifies the received payment result and displays to the consumer an appropriate page containing information on the result of the payment process. After returning to the online shop the consumer proceeds with browsing or shopping for additional items in the shop.

An e-mail for each transaction irrespective of the parameters confirmUrl or confirmMail is possible to get. Contact our sales team to enable the features above. To check the authenticity of the return values sent from the hobex Checkout Server to the online shop, compare the responseFingerprint with a hash of the return values. Create a string by concatenating all returned parameters and the secret based on the order in the return parameter responseFingerprintOrder. Then hash the string with an HMAC-SHA-512 algorithm using the secret as a cryptographic key and compare the result with the value of the return parameter responseFingerprint. If both values are identical, the response is authentic, and if they’re not, re-check the calculation. Save all return values after the payment process, or at least the returned order number received from Checkout Page via successUrl, cancelUrl, failureUrl, pendingUrl, or the confirmUrl, to be able to identify each payment of consumers at a later time and to correlate them to the corresponding session and order. To check the integration of Checkout Page use hobex Service IT Checkout Journal as a debugging tool that gives an overview of transaction details when doing a checkout. Due to data protection regulations access to the Journal for test transactions can’t be provided. To integrate Checkout Page into the online shop choose between the following display options: Page redirect In the online shop, consumers first select the desired items or services and start the checkout process usually by clicking the checkout button. Checkout Page opens by redirecting the consumers automatically from the online shop to Checkout Page which replaces the online shop entirely in the browser window. The hobex Service IT-URL is displayed in the address bar. After completing the payment process, consumers are redirected to the online shop and receive relevant information on the result or state of the payment which is sent to the respective successUrl, cancelUrl, failureUrl, or pendingUrl. Use the user interface customization possibilities, so the consumer still has the feeling to be in the online shop. When integrating Checkout Page as a page redirect, the external pages of financial institutions can be displayed as a pop-up or as another redirect to the financial service provider. Iframe Iframe integration is not recommended due to compatibility issues with certain financial institutions. In the online shop, consumers first select the desired items or services and start the checkout process usually by clicking the checkout button. An iframe embeds another website or a web page within the current HTML document. Iframes can be configured by their size and with or without scrollbars independently of the surrounding page’s scrollbars. Checkout Page can be integrated within an iframe in the HTML page of the online shop so that the whole checkout process is surrounded by the online shop and the consumer does not leave the shop. After completing the payment process, consumers are redirected to the online shop and receive relevant information on the result or state of the payment which is sent to the respective successUrl, cancelUrl, failureUrl or pendingUrl. Pop-up window Pop-up window integration is not recommended, because web browsers usually offer an option to block pop-up windows which are typically enabled by default. In the online shop, consumers first select the desired items or services and start the checkout process usually by clicking the checkout button. Checkout Page opens as a new browser window in front of the main window overlaying the online shop. After completing the payment process, the pop-up window is closed by hobex Service IT, consumers are redirected to the online shop and receive relevant information on the result or state of the payment which is sent to the respective successUrl, cancelUrl, failureUrl or pendingUrl. NOTE: Checkout Page redirects the consumer by default with a pop-up to all alternative payment methods. This might result in two pop-ups consecutively opening during the checkout process. The exception is cards with 3-D Secure which will be displayed as an iframe within Checkout Page or optionally as a page redirect. When integrating Checkout Page in a pop-up window, the external pages of financial institutions can be displayed as an additional pop-up or as a page redirect in the pop-up window. To use various display options for additional pages, from the financial service provider a different shopId can be requested and a different configuration can be set.

To prevent fraud, check the authenticity of returned data for pending and successful payments by calculating the fingerprint. That is done by concatenating all response parameter values plus the secret in the order defined in the responseFingerprintOrder parameter without any dividers in between and using the secret as a cryptographic key for the hashing function. The resulting fingerprint has to be identical to the value of the response responseFingerprint parameter.

After initialization, the Data Storage session for a specific consumer is valid for 30 minutes after the last access from the online shop to the Data Storage. After 30 minutes the session becomes invalid and a new Data Storage has to be initialized. For PHP we provide an example code on GitHub. The hobex Data Storage is only required for the following payment methods which manage sensitive payment data of the consumer: Credit Card Credit Card-Mail Order and Telephone Order Maestro SecureCode SEPA Direct Debit GooglePay For all other supported payment methods data doesn’t need to be stored in the Data Storage before starting the payment process itself. GooglePay works with SAQ-A implementation only!

Following this standard, a merchant’s website is not allowed to handle sensitive credit card-specific data by itself. hobex Service IT is a PCI DSS-certified third-party payment processor. The merchant or integrator can decide whether integrate Checkout Seamless without the \"PCI DSS SAQ A Compliance\" feature requiring PCI DSS v3.2.1 certification and compliance with SAQ A-EP, or with the \"PCI DSS SAQ A Compliance\" feature which was developed especially for Checkout Seamless and ensures compliance with PCI DSS v3.2.1 and is based on the less stringent SAQ A. When using Checkout Seamless, sensitive payment data are entered by the consumers in HTML forms in the online shop and directly transferred to hobex Service IT via JavaScript to be stored in the hobex Service IT Data Storage. Although sensitive data are never transferred to the online shop, compliance with the new PCI DSS v3.2.1 and corresponding SAQ A-EP is required. For \"PCI DSS SAQ A Compliance\" credit card relevant data are no longer transferred to hobex Service IT via JavaScript but are entered directly in a web form delivered by hobex Service IT. For this purpose, an iframe is displayed containing the relevant credit card input fields where the content of this iframe is directly delivered by hobex Service IT. Request parameters are optional parameters used to display or hide credit card-related input fields. For Credit Card <div id=\"creditcardDataIframe\"></div> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> var wd = new hobex Service IT_DataStorage(); wd.buildIframeCreditCard('creditcardDataIframe', '100%', '250px'); </script> For Credit Card-Mail Order and Telephone Order <div id=\"creditcardMotoDataIframe\"></div> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> var wd = new hobex Service IT_DataStorage(); wd.buildIframeCreditCardMoto('creditcardMotoDataIframe', '100%', '250px'); </script> For Maestro SecureCode <div id=\"MaestroDataIframe\"></div> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> var wd = new hobex Service IT_DataStorage(); wd.buildIframeMaestro('MaestroDataIframe', '100%', '250px'); </script> The buildIframe function contains: ID of the HTML element Iframe width Iframe height In order to immediately verify the correctness of entered credit card data and to proceed to the next step of the payment process. Credit Card dataStorage.storeCreditCardInformation(null, callbackFunction); Credit Card-Mail Order and Telephone Order dataStorage.storeCreditCardMotoInformation(null, callbackFunction); Maestro SecureCode dataStorage.storeMaestroInformation(null, callbackFunction); callbackFunction is a JavaScript function that allows handling the result of the storage operations, however, this function is optional since credit card-specific data are already stored during input when the consumer changes from one field to another. The result is only returned if the consumer’s browser supports postMessages; otherwise, the returned value is null. Browser minimum versions that support postMessage are Internet Explorer v8.0, Mozilla Firefox v3.0, Google Chrome v1.0, Safari v4.0, and Opera 9.5; older Android versions, e.g. v 2.3, might not support postMessage. hobex Service IT ensures the possibility to customize the iframe input fields according to the needs by using the parameter iframeCssUrl. To ensure that all elements within the checkout seamless are hosted by hobex Service IT systems and in order to provide for SAQ A compliance, this CSS file is received via the given URL in the request parameter iframeCssUrl from the server to the hobex Service IT server. After successful validation, the CSS file is subsequently loaded during each Data Storage init, parsed and delivered as an inline CSS file within the iframe. Our system uses a URL-based caching mechanism for this iframeCssUrl. To disable this mechanism, append the current timestamp as GET parameter, e.g. https://www.servername.com/iframe.css?2347. Due to security reasons, neither url() functions nor @import directives (e.g. external fonts) are allowed in the CSS file, and if they’re used they will be ignored. Never send any font changes within the CSS file, because security checks may last several minutes and lead to payment cancellation.","title":"PCI DSS SAQ A","component":"online-guides","version":"main","name":"pci-dss-saq-a","url":"/hosted/seamless/pci-dss-saq-a/","titles":[{"text":"PCI DSS SAQ A","hash":"pciDss","id":1},{"text":"Implementation","hash":"implementation","id":2},{"text":"Parameters","hash":"parameters","id":3},{"text":"Iframe","hash":"iframe","id":4},{"text":"Verification","hash":"verification","id":5},{"text":"Customization via CSS","hash":"customizationViaCss","id":6}]},"87":{"id":87,"text":"After initializing the Data Storage the merchant is able to start the payment of all payment methods which don’t need to store sensitive data in the hobex Data Storage. If the merchant supports payments that involve the handling of sensitive data then he needs to store these data in the Data Storage before the merchant starts the payment process. Data Storage session for a specific consumer is only valid for 30 minutes. Once this period of time has expired, the merchant has to initialize the Data Storage again and also has to store the sensitive payment data of the consumer again. At the start of the payment process, the merchant sends a server-to-server request from the web server to the hobex Checkout Server to a specific URL containing some specific request parameters: https://papi.hobex.at/seamless/frontend/init. It’s sometimes necessary to enable server-to-server requests in the configuration of the web server. The issue arises typically on provider-managed web servers with PHP. For a proper request, the merchant has to set the correct HTTP header elements within the request. Check how is fingerprint computed. Required Parameters for QMORE Checkout Seamless for Frontend Initiation. If GooglePay is initiated, the parameter paymentToken must be sent. Example to gather the required data //get all necessary data from hobex Data Storage return response $base_url = ( isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && $_SERVER['HTTPS']=='on' ? 'https' : 'http' ) . '://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']; $url = $base_url . $_SERVER[\"REQUEST_URI\"]; $url_components = parse_url($url, $component = -1); parse_str($url_components['query'], $params); //add required param for google pay transaction $postFields .= '&paymentToken='.$params['paymentToken']; //use as cryptogram $postFields .= '&browserData='.$params['browserData']; $postFields .= '&type=qmore'; After the send the initiation request as a server-to-server request from the web server to the hobex Checkout Server the merchant will get the result of the initiation as key-value pairs returned in the content of the response. If the initiation of the payment process was successful the merchant will receive a parameter called redirectUrl which he uses to redirect the consumer to the next page within the payment process. Typically the consumer is redirected to pages of financial institutions like internet banking pages or a page for entering the 3-D Secure code. Parameter Data type Description redirectUrl Alphanumeric URL to redirect the consumer. If the initialization did not succeed the error parameters will be received. Simplified code example for redirecting the consumer or retrieving errors if they occurred within the initiation: //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------// // Retrieves the value for the redirect URL. //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------// $redirectURL = \"\"; foreach (explode('&', $curlResult) as $keyvalue) { $param = explode('=', $keyvalue); if (sizeof($param) == 2) { $key = urldecode($param[0]); if ($key == \"redirectUrl\") { $redirectURL = urldecode($param[1]); break; } } } //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------// // Redirects consumer to payment page. //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------// if ($redirectURL == \"\") { echo \"<pre>\"; echo \"Frontend Intitiation failed with errors:\\n\\n\"; foreach (explode('&', $curlResult) as $keyvalue) { $param = explode('=', $keyvalue); if (sizeof($param) == 2) { $key = urldecode($param[0]); $value = urldecode($param[1]); echo $key . \" = \" . $value . \"\\n\"; } } echo \"</pre>\"; } else { header(\"Location: \" . $redirectURL); } Four possible results can be returned from Checkout Seamless to the confirmUrl: Table 1. Possible Results State Description SUCCESS The payment process has been successfully completed by the consumer. CANCEL The payment process has been canceled by the consumer. FAILURE The payment process has not been finished successfully by the consumer. PENDING The result of the payment process has yet to be determined. Typically occurs on payment methods requiring additional checks or actions by financial service providers or the consumer. When hobex Service IT retrieves updated information from the financial service provider, either a success or a failure is sent to the online shop. After the consumer has finished the payment process, Checkout Seamless sends the result to the online shop and the data is sent as a POST request. Be aware that the response parameters are only sent to the confirmUrl and not to the successUrl, cancelUrl, failureUrl or pendingUrl. The result of the payment can be processed depending on the parameter paymentState as shown in this simplified example: $paymentState = isset($_POST[\"paymentState\"]) ? $_POST[\"paymentState\"] : \"undefined\"; $message = \"The message text has not been set.\"; if (strcmp($paymentState, \"CANCEL\") == 0) { $message = \"The payment transaction has been canceled by the consumer.\"; } else if (strcmp($paymentState, \"PENDING\") == 0) { $message = \"The payment is pending and not yet finished.\"; } else if (strcmp($paymentState, \"FAILURE\") == 0) { $failure_message = isset($_POST[\"message\"]) ? $_POST[\"message\"] : \"\"; $message = \"An error occurred during the payment transaction: \" . $failure_message; } else if (strcmp($paymentState,\"SUCCESS\") == 0) { // check fingerprint and handle successful payment $message = \"The payment has been successfully completed.\"; } // store message and additional response parameter on the system After the result of the payment which was effected by consumer is sent to the confirmUrl on the web server, the consumer is redirected to one of the following URLs provided in the request parameters: successUrl cancelUrl failureUrl pendingUrl No additional parameters are sent when redirecting to one of these URLs. To check the authenticity of the return values sent from the hobex Checkout Server to the online shop, compare the responseFingerprint with an hash of the return values. Create a string by concatenating all returned parameters plus the secret based on the order in the return parameter responseFingerprintOrder. Then hash the string with an HMAC-SHA-512 algorithm using the secret as cryptographic key and compare the result with the value of the return parameter responseFingerprint. If both values are identical, the response is authentic, and if they’re not identical, re-check the calculation. Connection problems and technical issues on the web server may result in a loss of session-related information regarding consumer, e.g. the content of the shopping cart. Before starting the payment process in Checkout Seamless: Save all relevant data regarding the payment process in a persistent manner. Set the request parameter orderIdent to a unique ID regarding the session and order of consumer (session ID, an order number or a debit number). Use custom parameters to pass a unique ID corresponding to a payment process to the hobex Checkout Server. All of the custom parameters are returned to the online shop as return values after the payment process has been completed. After the payment process is completed: Save all returned values or at least the returned order number the merchant receives from the hobex Checkout Server. Also, the merchant can relate them to the initial data regarding the payment process. To check the integration of Checkout Seamless hobex Service IT Checkout Journal can be used as a debugging tool that gives an overview of transaction details when doing a checkout. Due to data protection regulations access to the Journal for test transactions can’t be provided.","title":"Seamless Payment Process","component":"online-guides","version":"main","name":"seamless-payment-process","url":"/hosted/seamless/seamless-payment-process/","titles":[{"text":"Seamless Payment Process","hash":"seamlessPaymentProcess","id":1},{"text":"Initiating the payment process","hash":"initiatingPaymentProcess","id":2},{"text":"Parameters","hash":"initiatingPaymentProcessParameters","id":3},{"text":"Parameter for GooglePay","hash":"initiatingPaymentProcessParametersGooglePay","id":4},{"text":"Return values from the server-to-server initiation request","hash":"returnValues","id":5},{"text":"Handling the result of the payment process","hash":"handlingResultPaymentProcess","id":6},{"text":"Receiving the result of a payment process","hash":"receivingResult","id":7},{"text":"Checking if returned values are valid","hash":"checking","id":8},{"text":"Storing payment results in online shop","hash":"storing","id":9},{"text":"hobex Service IT Checkout Journal","hash":"checkoutJournal","id":10}]},"88":{"id":88,"text":"After initializing the Data Storage the merchant is able to start the payment of all payment methods which don’t need to store sensitive data in the hobex Data Storage. If the merchant supports payments that involve the handling of sensitive data then he needs to store these data in the Data Storage before the merchant starts the payment process. Data Storage session for a specific consumer is only valid for 30 minutes. Once this period of time has expired, the merchant has to initialize the Data Storage again and also has to store the sensitive payment data of the consumer again. At the start of the payment process, the merchant sends a server-to-server request from the web server to the hobex Checkout Server to a specific URL containing some specific request parameters: https://papi.hobex.at/seamless/frontend/init. It’s sometimes necessary to enable server-to-server requests in the configuration of the web server. The issue arises typically on provider-managed web servers with PHP. For a proper request, the merchant has to set the correct HTTP header elements within the request. Check how is fingerprint computed. After the send the initiation request as a server-to-server request from the web server to the hobex Checkout Server the merchant will get the result of the initiation as key-value pairs returned in the content of the response. If the initiation of the payment process was successful the merchant will receive a parameter called redirectUrl which he uses to redirect the consumer to the next page within the payment process. Typically the consumer is redirected to pages of financial institutions like internet banking pages or a page for entering the 3-D Secure code. Parameter Data type Description redirectUrl Alphanumeric URL to redirect the consumer. If the initialization did not succeed the error parameters will be received. Simplified code example for redirecting the consumer or retrieving errors if they occurred within the initiation: //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------// // Retrieves the value for the redirect URL. //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------// $redirectURL = \"\"; foreach (explode('&', $curlResult) as $keyvalue) { $param = explode('=', $keyvalue); if (sizeof($param) == 2) { $key = urldecode($param[0]); if ($key == \"redirectUrl\") { $redirectURL = urldecode($param[1]); break; } } } //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------// // Redirects consumer to payment page. //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------// if ($redirectURL == \"\") { echo \"<pre>\"; echo \"Frontend Intitiation failed with errors:\\n\\n\"; foreach (explode('&', $curlResult) as $keyvalue) { $param = explode('=', $keyvalue); if (sizeof($param) == 2) { $key = urldecode($param[0]); $value = urldecode($param[1]); echo $key . \" = \" . $value . \"\\n\"; } } echo \"</pre>\"; } else { header(\"Location: \" . $redirectURL); } Four possible results can be returned from Checkout Seamless to the confirmUrl: Table 1. Possible Results State Description SUCCESS The payment process has been successfully completed by the consumer. CANCEL The payment process has been canceled by the consumer. FAILURE The payment process has not been finished successfully by the consumer. PENDING The result of the payment process has yet to be determined. Typically occurs on payment methods requiring additional checks or actions by financial service providers or the consumer. When hobex Service IT retrieves updated information from the financial service provider, either a success or a failure is sent to the online shop. After the consumer has finished the payment process, Checkout Seamless sends the result to the online shop and the data is sent as a POST request. Be aware that the response parameters are only sent to the confirmUrl and not to the successUrl, cancelUrl, failureUrl or pendingUrl. The result of the payment can be processed depending on the parameter paymentState as shown in this simplified example: $paymentState = isset($_POST[\"paymentState\"]) ? $_POST[\"paymentState\"] : \"undefined\"; $message = \"The message text has not been set.\"; if (strcmp($paymentState, \"CANCEL\") == 0) { $message = \"The payment transaction has been canceled by the consumer.\"; } else if (strcmp($paymentState, \"PENDING\") == 0) { $message = \"The payment is pending and not yet finished.\"; } else if (strcmp($paymentState, \"FAILURE\") == 0) { $failure_message = isset($_POST[\"message\"]) ? $_POST[\"message\"] : \"\"; $message = \"An error occurred during the payment transaction: \" . $failure_message; } else if (strcmp($paymentState,\"SUCCESS\") == 0) { // check fingerprint and handle successful payment $message = \"The payment has been successfully completed.\"; } // store message and additional response parameter on the system After the result of the payment which was effected by consumer is sent to the confirmUrl on the web server, the consumer is redirected to one of the following URLs provided in the request parameters: successUrl cancelUrl failureUrl pendingUrl No additional parameters are sent when redirecting to one of these URLs.

Max. length of a parameter name must not exceed 64 characters. Max. length of the value of a parameter must not exceed 65000 characters. Custom parameters can be added when starting the payment process. Any names can be used for custom parameters except for those that already exist as our request parameters. To prevent naming conflicts with possible future extensions of hobex Service IT solutions use a prefix for custom parameter names e.g. yourWebshopName_customValueXYZ. For Checkout Page all of the custom parameters are returned without any modification to the online shop via successUrl,cancelUrl, pendingUrl, failureUrl or confirmUrl. For Checkout Seamless all of the custom parameters are returned without modifications to the online shop via the confirmUrl. No parameters are returned to the successUrl when using Checkout Seamless. The fingerprint is computed by concatenating all request parameter values plus the secret in the order defined in the parameter requestFingerprintOrder without any dividers in between and using the secret as a cryptographic key for the hashing function. Be aware that the concatenation of the request parameters and the secret has to be done in the order as defined within the detailed description of each backend operation. After concatenating all values to a single string create an HMAC-SHA-512 hash with a secret as a cryptographic key. The result is the fingerprint that must be added as a request parameter to the server-to-server call. The hobex Checkout Server is thus able to check whether the received parameters are manipulated by a 3rd party.
